campaign with something unique and memorable that would build brand awareness was needed. the aflac ducks first commercial in the u.s., park bench, aired on january 1, 2000 and taught consumers how to pronounce aflac. the aflac duck made his international debut in japan in 2003. in the time since his u.s. debut, the aflac duck has become one of the most familiar advertising icons in the world, appearing in many commercials and countless print ads in both the u.s. and japan. today, the aflac duck is a helpmate who increases brand knowledge and connection. the companys insurance business

designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under japans national health insurance system. changes in japans economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on japans national health care system. as a result, more costs have been shifted to japanese consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs. aflac japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products. the focus at aflac japan remains on maintaining leadership in third sector insurance products that are less interest rate sensitive and have strong and stable margins. at the same time, aflac japan complements this core business with similarly profitable first

product design and sales efforts, as the number of insurance companies offering stand alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the deregulation of the japan market in 2001. however, based on aflac japans size of annualized premiums in force and diversified distribution network, the company believes it is well positioned to continue to adapt to increased competition. furthermore, the company believes the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow aflac japan to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers. the company believes aflac japan will remain a leading provider of third sector products such as cancer and medical insurance coverage in japan, principally due to its experience in the market, well known brand, low cost operations, expansive marketing system and product expertise.government regulationfinancial services agency (fsa) the financial and business affairs of aflac japan are subject to examination by japans

insurance products. brokers the broker channel of aflac u.s. focuses on selling to the mid and large case market, which is comprised of employers with 100 or more employees and typically an average size of 1,000 employees or more. brokers in the u.s. are 6item 1. businessindependent contractors and are paid commissions based on first year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products.in 2023, the aflac u.s. sales force included an average of approximately 6,200 u.s. agents, including brokers, who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. for additional information, see the aflac u.s. segment subsection of item 7. md&a.consumer markets while aflac u.s. primarily markets its insurance products at the worksite, aflac u.s. is also expanding its distribution strategy to directly reach consumers outside of the traditional worksite through digital lead generation. competitive marketsaflac u.s. competes against several supplemental insurance carriers on a national and regional basis. aflac u.s. believes its policies, premium rates, platforms, value added services and sales commissions are competitive by product type. moreover, aflac u.s. believes that its products are distinct from competitive offerings given its product focus (including features, benefits and claims service model), distribution capabilities and brand awareness. since aflac products provide an additional level of financial protection for policyholders, the company believes the increased financial exposure some employees may face creates a favorable opportunity for aflac u.s. products. however, given the profitability erosion some major medical carriers are facing in their core lines of business, the company has seen a more competitive landscape as these carriers seek entry into aflacs supplemental product segments and leverage their core benefit offerings by bundling and discounting products in order to gain market share.government regulationstate insurance regulation the parent company and its u.s. insurance subsidiaries, aflac, caic, toic (nebraska domiciled insurance companies), aflac new york (a new york domiciled insurance company) and abs (a licensed third party administrator in most u.s. jurisdictions and a pre paid limited health service organization in florida) are subject to state regulations in the u.s. as an insurance holding company system. such regulations generally provide that certain transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. in addition, transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain transactions between companies within the system, including management fees, loans and advances are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities. these laws generally require, among other things, the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system.like all u.s. insurance companies, aflac, caic, toic and aflac new york are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. in general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things:granting and revoking licenses to transact businessregulating trade and claims practiceslicensing of insurance agents and brokersapproval of policy forms and premium ratesstandards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirementscapital requirementslimitations on dividends to shareholdersthe nature of and limitations on investmentsdeposits of securities for the benefit of policyholdersfiling of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authoritiesperiodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companiesthe insurance laws of nebraska that govern the companys activities provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the nebraska department of insurance (ndoi). a person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company (in the case of aflac, caic and toic, the parent company) must generally file with the ndoi an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to the company. in nebraska, control is generally 7item 1. businesspresumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, acquires 10% or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company. the 10% presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10%. similar laws apply in new york, the domiciliary jurisdiction of aflacs new york insurance subsidiary.state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic). in 2024, the ndoi and the new york state department of financial services (nysdfs) will commence full scope, risk focused financial examinations on their respective state domiciled insurance entities. the examinations will cover the reporting period january 1, 2020 december 31, 2023. in 2023, the nysdfs commenced a routine market conduct examination on aflac new york covering the five year period ended on december 31, 2022 that is currently ongoing.naic risk based capital the naic continually reviews regulatory matters, such as risk based capital (rbc) modernization, group capital calculations and liquidity risk assessment. the naic uses an rbc formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurers operations. the formulas for determining the amount of rbc specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a companys regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level rbc as defined by the naic. companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. the levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of item 7. md&a for additional information on rbc.guaranty association and similar arrangements under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, the company is subject to assessments, based on the share of business the company writes in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. in the u.s., some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. the companys policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domiciles statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. in most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. federal regulation federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. certain federal regulations applicable to aflac u.s. are outlined below. patient protection and affordable care act the patient protection and affordable care act and the heath care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the aca), federal health care reform legislation, gave the u.s. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. the aca, as enacted, does not require material changes in the design of the companys insurance products. however, indirect consequences of, or changes to, the legislation and regulations could present challenges that could potentially have an impact on the companys sales model, financial condition and results of operations. certain provisions of the aca have been and may continue to be subject to challenge through litigation, the ultimate effects of which on the aca are uncertain. see item 1a. risk factors for the risk factor entitled, "extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth" for additional information. dodd frank acttitle vii of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (dodd frank) and regulations issued thereunder, in particular rules to require central clearing for certain types of derivatives, may have an impact on the companys derivative activity, including activity on behalf of aflac japan. 8item 1. businessthe dodd frank act also established a federal insurance office (fio) under the u.s. department of the treasury to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long term care insurance and crop insurance. privacy and cybersecurity in the absence of a comprehensive federal privacy law, states are making a push towards privacy legislation. personally identifiable information is used in support of many of the companys business processes. for many years, the standard for protection and treatment of that data was benchmarked by privacy and security provisions of the federal gramm leach bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). as consumers have grown more concerned about the protection of their data, as well as how their data is used by an organization, many jurisdictions within and outside of the u.s. have created legislation and issued regulations that apply or may in the future apply to aspects of aflac u.s. operations and allow consumers the right to access, correct, delete and the right to opt out of sales or use of their data. examples of these types of legislation include the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), the california privacy rights act (cpra), the uk general data protection regulation (uk gdpr), the uk data protection act of 2018 (uk dpa) and most recently, effective in 2023, the connecticut data privacy act (cdpa), the utah consumer privacy act (ucpa), the virginia consumer data protection act (vcdpa) and the colorado privacy act (cpa). cybersecurity continues to be an area of evolving focus for legislation and regulatory activity. in addition to the information required by item 1c. cybersecurity of this report, industry regulators as well as the federal government have updated existing standards and increased their focus on enforcement. for example, the national institute of standards and technology (nist) issued guidelines on managing risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence, the naic adopted a model bulletin on the use of artificial intelligence systems by insurers and the cybersecurity & infrastructure security agency (cisa) published additional security guidelines related to ransomware. the company has a cross functional team that tracks and monitors new and emerging legislation and regulations to ensure privacy and cybersecurity programs are evaluated and comply with regulatory requirements. this includes a robust third party risk management and assessment program. over the last several years, processes have developed to support the data subject request process required by ccpa, privacy impact assessments have been implemented as required by cpra and a dedicated privacy and security center has been added to the company website to provide consumers with information about the use of and protection of their data.tri agency proposed rulein july 2023, the u.s. department of labor, u.s. department of the treasury and u.s. department of health and human services issued a proposed joint rule that, as written, would impose significant limitations on the structure of benefits for hospital indemnity and other fixed indemnity plans, including those sold by aflac u.s. the current benefit structure for these products allows the company to vary the amount of benefits by the services or items received, severity of illness or injury, or any other characteristics particular to a course of treatment. if finalized in its current form, the proposed rule would eliminate aflac u.s.s ability to vary the amount of benefits provided by these products. the timing and substance of the final regulations, if any, is not known, and any such final rule could be the subject of litigation. for further information concerning aflac u.s. operations, see the aflac u.s. segment subsection of item 7. md&a and notes 2 and 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.corporate and otherthe companys other operations include the parent company, aflac global ventures llc and its subsidiaries, asset management subsidiaries, results of reinsurance activities including aflac re bermuda ltd.

are reported in corporate and other; however, the assets that they manage are reported in the respective aflac japan and aflac u.s. segments.in 2022, the company established aflac re, a bermuda domiciled insurer that reinsures certain policies issued by alij. aflac re is subject to regulation in bermuda, where the bermuda monetary authority (bma) has broad administrative powers relating to granting and revoking licenses to transact reinsurance business, approval of specific reinsurance transactions, capital requirements and solvency standards, limitations on dividends to shareholders, the nature of and limitations on investments, and the filing of financial statements in accordance with prescribed or permitted accounting practices.in 2020, the company purchased newly issued common stock of trupanion, inc., a provider of medical insurance for pets in the united states and canada, resulting in the company owning approximately 9% of the outstanding common stock of trupanion, inc. the shares were registered for resale and, pursuant to the shareholder agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the company agreed that it would not transfer its shares of trupanion, inc. common stock during a restricted period that ended on november 13, 2023. the company also entered into an alliance agreement with trupanion, inc. to sell pet insurance in worksites in the u.s., subject to certain exceptions. in december 2023, the company and trupanion announced their decision not to pursue joint development of pet insurance in japan.for additional information on the companys other operations, see the corporate and other subsection of item 7. md&a and note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. human capitalthe companys overarching human capital philosophy is,

enterprise risk exposures. readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this form 10 k. these risks and other factors may affect forward looking statements, including those in this document or made by the company elsewhere, such as in earnings release webcasts, investor conference presentations or press releases. the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, there could be a material impact on the company.investment and markets risk factorsdifficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on the companys investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm the companys business. the companys results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the global economy generally, including in its two primary operating markets of the u.s. and japan. high rates of inflation globally from 2022 were reduced due to monetary tightening in many countries and normalization of certain trends after covid 19, including supply chain recovery and phasing out of extraordinary fiscal support. although economies have proved resilient in the face of interest rate increases, tighter financial conditions for a prolonged period may result in continued weakening of economic conditions. japan remains an exception to the major central bank tightening trend. armed conflicts in ukraine and the middle east, as well as political polarization in the u.s., exacerbate uncertainty. geopolitical events have contributed to volatility in energy and other commodity prices. the failure of several large u.s. banks and ubss acquisition of credit suisse in early 2023 did not trigger a wider financial crisis at the time, but sustained high interest rates and economic decline could continue pressuring the financial health of other financial institutions. higher interest rates and softer economic conditions could impact the creditworthiness and value of the companys existing investment portfolio, influence opportunities for new investments and have a negative impact on the companys results of operations and financial positions.the companys investments are vulnerable to adverse market developments such as asset price volatility, lack of market liquidity, credit rating downgrades, payment defaults, asset restructurings, increased losses, and other risks. the company has evaluated its holdings and identified investments in areas such as commercial real estate and highly leveraged companies as the most exposed to rising interest rates and an economic downturn. these investments are experiencing and may continue to experience higher credit losses, credit rating downgrades and or defaults and a deterioration in the value of collateral in the case of secured investments. the company has examined in each case whether a reduction in size of the holding is appropriate. the company has identified assets impacted or expected to be impacted by rising interest rates and economic contraction, other investments not identified to date may also be impacted. the availability of new investments in certain private market asset classes has been and may continue to be limited. while interest rates have increased in the u.s. and other regions, interest rates in japan remain low, and the difference between u.s. and japan rates has increased. the company may need to adjust its investment strategy and or be forced to liquidate investments to pay claims. in addition, the increase in the difference between interest rates in the u.s. and japan contributed to a weakening of the yen over 2023, which had the effect of suppressing the companys current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. the increase in the difference between u.s. dollar and yen interest rates also contributes to increasing costs of hedging currency risk of u.s. dollar denominated investments held by aflac japan. the company is not able to predict the ultimate impact of inflation, interest rate increases, interest rate differences and other changing market conditions on the companys investments and hedging programs. see the risk factor below entitled, the company is exposed to significant interest rate risk, which may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity for additional information. see the investments and results of operations by segment sections of item 7. md&a, for additional information. as the company holds a significant amount of fixed maturity securities issued by borrowers located in many different parts of the world, its financial results are directly influenced by global financial markets. recent weakness in global capital markets could adversely affect the companys financial condition, including its capital position and overall profitability. market volatility and recessionary pressures could result in significant realized or unrealized losses due to severe price declines driven by increases in interest rates or credit spreads, defaults in payment of principal or interest, or credit rating downgrades.japan is the largest market for the companys insurance products, and the company owns substantial holdings in japan government bonds (jgbs). government actions to stimulate the economy affect the value of the companys existing 13item 1a. risk factorsholdings, its reinvestment rate on new investments in jgbs or other yen denominated assets, and consumer behavior relative to the companys suite of insurance products. the additional government debt from fiscal stimulus actions could adversely impact the japan sovereign credit profile, which could in turn lead to volatility in japanese capital and currency markets.should investors become concerned with any of the companys investment holdings, including the concentration in jgbs, its access to market sources of funding could be negatively impacted. it is possible that lenders or debt investors may also become concerned if the company incurs large investment losses or if the level of the companys business activity decreases due to a market downturn or there are further adverse economic trends in the u.s. or japan, specifically, or generally in developed markets. the company needs liquidity to pay its operating expenses, dividends on its common stock, interest on its debt, and liabilities. see the liquidity and capital resources section of item 7. md&a, for additional information. in the event the companys current resources do not meet its needs, the company may need to seek additional financing. the companys access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit within the financial services industry and its credit rating. see the risk factor below entitled, any decrease in the companys financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on its competitive position and access to liquidity and capital for additional information.broad economic factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation, as well as ongoing central bank responses to these factors, all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of the companys business. in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. this adverse effect could be particularly significant for companies such as aflac that distribute supplemental, discretionary insurance products primarily through the worksite in the event that economic conditions result in a decrease in the number of new hires and total employees. adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead the companys customers to be less inclined to purchase supplemental insurance coverage or to decide to cancel or modify existing insurance coverage. further, aflac u.s. may experience higher rates of policy lapses during periods of increased job turnover and workforce mobility within the u.s. economy. the above factors could adversely affect the companys net earned premiums, results of operations and financial condition. the company is unable to predict the course of the global financial markets or the recurrence, duration or severity of disruptions in such markets.defaults, downgrades, widening credit spreads or other events impairing the value of the fixed maturity securities and loan receivables in the companys investment portfolio may reduce the companys earnings and capital position.the company is subject to the risk that the issuers and or guarantors of fixed maturity securities and loan receivables the company owns may default on principal or interest. a significant portion of the companys portfolio represents an unsecured obligation of the issuer, including some that may be subordinated to other debt in the issuers capital structure. in these cases, many factors can influence the overall creditworthiness of the issuer and ultimately its ability to service and repay the companys holdings. this can include changes in the global economy, the issuers assets, strategy, or management, shifts in the dynamics of the industries in which the issuer competes, the issuers access to additional funding, and the overall health of the credit markets. factors unique to the companys securities including contractual protections such as financial covenants or relative position in the issuers capital structure also influence the value of the companys holdings. in addition, for investments representing secured obligations of an issuer, such as mortgage loan receivables, the underlying value of the collateral may not be sufficient to fully recover the amount of principal and interest owed to the company if a default occurs.most of the companys investments carry a rating by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (nrsros or rating agencies). any change in the rating agencies approach to evaluating credit and assigning an opinion could negatively impact the fair value of the companys portfolio. any expected or sustained credit deterioration of the companys investments will negatively impact the companys net income and capital position through credit impairment and other credit related losses. credit related losses that are not temporary in nature would also affect the companys solvency ratios in the u.s., japan and bermuda. aflac japan has certain regulatory accounting requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by credit related losses, which may be different from u.s. gaap and statutory requirements. these impairment losses could negatively impact aflac japans earnings, and the corresponding dividends and capital deployment. the company is also subject to the risk that any collateral providing credit enhancement to the companys investments could deteriorate. 14item 1a. risk factorsthe company is also exposed to the general movement in credit market spreads. a widening of credit spreads could reduce the value of the companys existing portfolio, create unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, and reduce the companys adjusted capital position and or the dividend capacity of the companys insurance subsidiaries. a tightening of credit spreads could reduce the net investment income available to the company on new credit investments. increased market volatility also makes it difficult to value certain of the companys investment holdings. for additional information, see the critical accounting estimates section of item 7. md&a, and the credit risk subsection of item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.the company is exposed to significant interest rate risk, which may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.the company has substantial investment portfolios that support its policy liabilities. interest rate risk is an inherent portfolio, business and capital risk for the company, and significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, changes in unrealized positions, and liquidity. changes in interest rates could also result in the company having to recognize gains or losses because the company disposes of some or all of its investments prior to their maturity.the companys exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the ability to invest future cash flows to support the interest rate assumption made at the time of the establishment of the companys product pricing and reserving. low levels of interest rates on investments experienced in japan and the u.s. over the last decade have also reduced the level of investment income earned by the company. while interest rates have increased in the u.s. and other regions, interest rates in japan remain lower than in the u.s., and the companys overall level of investment income will continue to be negatively impacted from japans low interest rates and from investments made prior to the start of recent rate increases. while the company generally seeks to maintain a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the cash flow and duration characteristics of the liabilities it supports, the company may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of its assets relative to its liabilities. prolonged periods of low interest rates also heighten the risk associated with future increases in interest rates because an increasing proportion of the companys investment portfolio include investments that bear lower rates of return than the embedded book yield of the investment portfolio.a sustained decline in interest rates could hinder the companys ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for its insurance products at the time of sale and issue and may also influence the companys ability to develop and price attractive new products and could impact its overall sales levels. the companys first sector products are more interest rate sensitive than third sector products. as discussed in item 1. business, beginning in november 2022, aflac japan refreshed its first sector savings type products ways and child endowment and began to actively promote sales of those products, which had been curtailed since 2013 due to persistent low interest rates in japan. the continuing negative interest rate imposed by the bank of japan (boj) on excess bank reserves could continue to have a negative impact on the distribution and pricing of these products. additionally, a decrease in interest rates increases the fair value of the companys fixed maturity investments, which could result in increases to the companys overall equity. however, the decrease in interest rates increases the liability for future policy benefits (lfpb), which could result in reductions to the companys overall equity. conversely and concurrently, a rise in interest rates would improve the companys ability to earn higher rates of return on future investments, as well as floating rate investments held in its investment portfolio. a rise in interest rates also decreases the lfpb, which could result in increases to the companys overall equity. however, rising interest rates negatively impact the fair values of the companys fixed maturity investments which could result in reductions to the companys overall equity. portfolio management considerations, the availability of investments, as well as declines in fair value may constrain the ability of the company to transition its investments to higher rate securities. significant increases in interest rates could cause declines in the values of the companys investment portfolio which have a secondary impact on the companys overall evaluation of its deferred tax asset position. an increase in the differential of short term u.s. and japan interest rates would also increase the cost of hedging a portion of the u.s. dollar denominated assets in the aflac japan segment into yen, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations or financial condition. further, some of the insurance products that aflac sells in the u.s. and japan provide cash surrender values, and a rise in interest rates could trigger significant policy surrenders, which might require the company to sell investment assets and recognize unrealized losses. rising interest rates also negatively impact capital ratios in certain jurisdictions because unrealized losses on the available for sale investment portfolio factor into the ratio. in addition to the unrealized losses negatively impacting capital ratios, significant unrealized losses could impact the amount of dividends that could be paid under local regulations, including in japan. for aflac japan, rising interest rates and widening credit spreads, which go to reduce the fair value of aflac japans fixed maturity investments, when combined with a strengthening yen, and the resulting decrease in the yen value of aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturity 15item 1a. risk factorsinvestments, have a negative impact to smr. for regulatory accounting purposes for aflac japan, there are also certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by rising interest rates, negatively impacting aflac japans regulatory earnings and corresponding dividends and capital deployment. see the interest rate risk subsection of item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information. the companys concentration of business in japan poses risks to its operations and financial condition.aflac japans adjusted revenues accounted for 60% of the companys total adjusted revenues in 2023, compared with 64% in 2022 and 68% in 2021. the percentage of the companys total assets attributable to aflac japan was 80% at both december 31, 2023 and 2022. see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.any potential deterioration in japans credit quality or access to markets, the overall economy of japan, or an increase in japanese market volatility could adversely impact aflac japans operations and its financial condition and thereby aflacs overall financial performance. further, because of the concentration of the companys business in japan and its need for long dated yen denominated assets, the company has a substantial concentration of jgbs in its investment portfolio exposing the company to credit deterioration and potential downgrades of jgbs. see the risk factor entitled any decrease in the companys financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on its competitive position and access to liquidity and capital for additional information. the company seeks to match investment currency and interest rate risk to its yen liabilities. the low interest rates on yen denominated securities has a negative effect on overall net investment income. a large portion of the cash available for reinvestment each year is deployed in yen denominated instruments and subject to the low level of yen interest rates. lack of availability of acceptable yen denominated investments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity.the company aims to match both the duration and currency of its assets with its liabilities. this is very difficult for aflac japan and aflac re due to the lack of available long dated yen denominated fixed income instruments beyond jgbs. aflac japans investment strategy includes u.s. dollar denominated investments. this program includes public investment grade bonds as well as u.s. dollar denominated investment grade commercial mortgage loans, middle market loans, infrastructure debt, collateralized loan obligations and other loan types, high yield bond and public and private equities. the company plans to continue adding other instruments denominated in u.s. dollars, including floating rate investments, to improve the portfolio diversification and or return profile. some of the u.s. dollar denominated asset classes that the company has added, and anticipates continuing to add, have less liquidity than investment grade corporate bonds. aflac res investment strategy also includes u.s. dollar denominated investments that are presently comprised exclusively of public investment grade bonds.investing in u.s. dollar denominated investments in aflac japan and aflac re creates an unmatched foreign currency exposure and related capital ratio volatility, as both aflac japan and aflac re insurance liabilities are yen denominated. although the company engages in certain foreign exchange hedging activities to partially mitigate this risk, and such hedged assets may be used to satisfy yen denominated insurance liabilities and other business obligations, important risks remain.in recent years, the company has reduced the proportion of u.s. dollar denominated investments that are subject to a currency hedge, and this proportion continues to be subject to change at the companys discretion. the company has increased u.s. dollar risk exposure as the comprehensive hedging program may not always correlate to the underlying u.s. dollar denominated assets, thereby increasing earnings volatility. these risks can significantly impact the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.further, foreign exchange derivatives used for hedging are periodically settled, which results in cash receipt or payment at maturity or early termination. cumulative net cash settlements on derivatives hedging currency exposure of aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated investments are associated with existing u.s. dollar denominated investments that continue to be hedged, previously hedged investments that continue to be held but are no longer hedged, and investments previously hedged that have since been sold, matured or redeemed and may or may not have not been converted to yen. the companys foreign exchange derivatives are typically shorter dated than the underlying u.s. dollar denominated investments being hedged, which creates roll over risks within the hedging program that could increase the cost of such 16item 1a. risk factorsderivatives. if the company reduces the notional amount of foreign exchange derivatives prior to the maturity of the hedged u.s. dollar denominated investments, the foreign exchange gains or losses on the u.s. dollar denominated investments remain economically unrealized. these foreign currency gains or losses on the investments are only economically realized, or monetized, through sale, maturity or redemption of the investments and concurrent conversion to yen. however, the company may not realize the benefit of offsetting adverse cash settlements on hedging derivatives with cash receipts on the u.s. dollar denominated investments if the currency exchange rates move in an adverse direction before the investments are converted to yen, or if the investments are never converted to yen. as an example of the latter, if the companys actual insurance risk experience in japan is as expected or more favorable than expected, the need for yen to pay expenses and claims would correspondingly remain at or below expected levels, thereby diminishing operational requirements to convert u.s. dollar denominated investments to yen. the settlement of the foreign exchange derivatives is reported in the investing activities section of the companys consolidated statements of cash flows in the line item settlement of derivatives, net.see the risk factor entitled the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate, the hedging activities subsection of item 7. md&a, and the currency risk subsection of item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate.due to the size of aflac japan, where functional currency is the japanese yen, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the yen and the u.s. dollar can have a significant effect on the companys reported financial position and results of operations. aflac japans premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and almost all expenses are paid in yen. aflac japan purchases yen denominated assets and u.s. dollar denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen denominated policy liabilities. certain unhedged u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities held by aflac japan are re measured to yen with the volatility reported in earnings. furthermore, the yen denominated balance sheet of aflac japan is translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes with foreign exchange impact reflected in equity. accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the companys reported financial position and results of operations. yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. in addition, the weakening of the yen relative to the u.s. dollar will generally adversely affect the value of the companys yen denominated investments in u.s. dollar terms. when the yen strengthens in relation to the u.s. dollar, the yen value of aflac japans unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investments decreases, resulting in a decrease in smr. further, unhedged u.s. dollar denominated securities held by aflac japan are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, which also impact smr. as a result, periods of unusually volatile currency exchange rates could result in limitations on dividends available to the parent company.the company engages in certain foreign currency hedging activities to hedge the exposure to yen from its net investment in japanese operations. these hedging activities are limited in scope, and the company cannot provide assurance that these activities will be effective. in addition, an increase in the difference between short term u.s. and japan interest rates would increase the cost of hedging a portion of the u.s. dollar denominated assets in the aflac japan segment into yen, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations or financial condition. as indicated in md&a, the company has determined that the unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investment portfolio acts as a natural economic currency hedge of a portion of the companys investment in aflac japan against erosion of economic value. at the same time, the unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investment portfolio creates an unmatched foreign currency exposure and subjects aflac japan to volatility in regulatory capital, including smr, and earnings, which may adversely impact aflac japans ability to pay dividends to the parent company. the company has historically maintained and currently maintains the size of the unhedged portfolio at levels below the economic equity surplus in aflac japan, but there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful.for regulatory accounting purposes, there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by changes in the rate of exchange between the yen and u.s. dollar and could negatively impact aflac japans earnings and the corresponding dividends and capital deployment. additionally, the company is exposed to currency risk when yen cash flows are converted into u.s. dollars, resulting in changes in the companys u.s. dollar denominated cash flows and earnings when exchange gains or losses, respectively, are realized. this primarily occurs when aflac japan pays dividends in yen to the parent company, but it also has an impact when cash in the form of yen is converted to u.s. dollars for investment into u.s. dollar denominated assets. the exchange rates prevailing at the time of dividend payment may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. the parent company utilizes forward contracts to accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency exchange rate risk related to dividend payments by aflac japan, and reducing enterprise wide 17item 1a. risk factorshedge costs. however, if the markets experience a significant strengthening of yen, this could cause cash strain at the parent company as a result of cash collateral and potentially cash settlement requirements. based on the timing and severity of exchange rate fluctuations combined with the level of outstanding activity in this program, the cash strain at the parent company could be significant. for additional information regarding unhedged u.s. dollar denominated securities, see the risk factor above entitled, lack of availability of acceptable yen denominated investments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity. see the currency risk subsection of item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.the valuation of the companys investments and derivatives includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect the companys results of operations or financial condition.the company reports a significant amount of its fixed maturity securities and other investments at fair value. as such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and valuation methods that are more sophisticated, thereby resulting in values that may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within the companys consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly.valuations of the companys derivatives fluctuate with changes in underlying market variables, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. during periods of market turbulence created by political instability, economic uncertainty, government interventions or other factors, the company may experience significant changes in the volatility of its derivative valuations. extreme market conditions can also affect the liquidity of such instruments creating marked differences in transaction levels and counterparty valuations. depending on the severity and direction of the movements in its derivative valuations, the company will face increases in the amount of collateral required to be posted with its counterparties. liquidity stresses to the company may also occur if the required collateral amounts increase significantly over a very short period of time. conversely, the company may be exposed to an increase in counterparty credit risk for short periods of time while calling collateral from its counterparties.see the critical accounting estimates section of item 7. md&a, and notes 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.the determination of the amount of expected credit losses recorded on the companys investments is based on significant valuation judgments and could materially impact its results of operations or financial position.the company estimates an expected lifetime credit loss on investments measured at amortized cost including held to maturity fixed maturity securities, loan receivables and loan commitments. for collateral dependent financial assets, including loans where foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. for the companys available for sale fixed maturity securities, the company evaluates estimated credit losses only when the fair value of the available for sale fixed maturity security is below its amortized cost basis.the companys approach to estimating credit losses is complex and incorporates significant judgments. in addition to a security, or an asset class, or issuer specific credit fundamentals, it considers relevant historical information (e.g. loss statistics), current market conditions and reasonable and supportable micro and macroeconomic forecasts. the companys management updates its expected credit loss assumptions regularly as conditions change and as new information becomes available and reflects expected credit losses in the companys earnings when considered necessary. furthermore, additional credit losses may need to be taken in the future. historical trends may not be indicative of future expectations of credit losses. see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.the company cannot provide assurance that these evaluations will be accurate and effective. if the companys estimates of credit losses are not accurate and actual credit losses are higher than the companys estimates, the companys net income and capital position will be negatively impacted. these higher losses would also negatively affect the companys solvency ratios in the u.s. and japan. for regulatory accounting purposes for aflac japan, there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by rising interest rates, credit related losses, or changes in foreign exchange, negatively impacting aflac japans earnings and corresponding dividend and capital deployment. 18item 1a. risk factorsany decrease in the companys financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on its competitive position and access to liquidity and capital.nrsros may change their ratings or outlook on an insurers ratings due to a variety of factors including but not limited to competitive position; profitability; cash generation and other sources of liquidity; capital levels; quality of the investment portfolio; and perception of management capabilities. the ratings assigned to the company by the nrsros are important factors in the companys ability to access liquidity and capital from the bank market, debt capital markets or other available sources, such as reinsurance transactions. downgrades of the companys credit ratings could give its derivative counterparties the right to require early termination of derivatives transactions or delivery of additional collateral, thereby adversely affecting the companys liquidity. downgrades of the companys ratings could also have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and retention, sales, competitiveness and the marketability of its products, all of which could negatively impact the companys liquidity, operating results and financial condition. additionally, sales through the bank channel in japan could be adversely affected as a result of their reliance on and sensitivity to ratings levels.the company cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions the company may take in response to the actions of rating agencies. as with other companies in the financial services industry, the companys ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any nrsro.a decline in the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the company.the company has exposure to and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker dealers, derivative counterparties, commercial banks and other institutions. the company uses derivative instruments to mitigate various risks associated with its investment portfolio, notes payable, and subsidiary dividends. the companys use of derivatives results in financial exposure to derivative counterparties. if the companys counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under derivative instruments, the companys hedges of the risks will be ineffective, and the companys financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the company engages in derivative transactions directly with affiliates and unaffiliated third parties under international swaps and derivatives association, inc. (isda) agreements and other documentation. most of the isda agreements also include credit support annexes (csas), which generally provide for two way collateral postings at the first dollar of exposure. in addition, a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction upon a downgrade of aflacs financial strength rating. the actual amount of payments that the company could be required to make depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions, and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade. if the company is required to post collateral to support derivative contracts and or pay cash to settle the contracts at maturity, the companys liquidity could be strained. in addition, the companys cleared swaps result in counterparty exposure to clearing brokers and central clearinghouses; while this exposure is mitigated in part by clearinghouse and clearing broker capital and regulation, no assurance can be provided that these counterparties will fulfill their obligations. the company also has exposure to counterparties to securities lending transactions in the event they fail to return loaned securities. the company is also exposed to the risk that there may be a decline in value of securities posted as collateral for securities lending programs or a decline in value of investments made with cash posted as collateral for such programs.further, the company has agreements with various japanese financial institutions for the distribution of its insurance products. for example, at december 31, 2023, the company had agreements with 360 banks to market aflacs products in japan. sales through these banks represented 3.3% of aflac japans new annualized premium sales in 2023. any material adverse effect on these or other financial institutions could also have an adverse effect on the companys sales.the company has entered into significant reinsurance transactions with large, highly rated counterparties, including affiliates. in addition, aflac japan has entered into reinsurance transactions with aflac re. aflac re is a newly formed entity with less capital than external counterparties with which the company has conducted reinsurance transactions in the past. negative events or developments affecting any one of these counterparties could have an adverse effect on the companys financial position or results of operations.all of these risks related to exposure to other financial institutions could adversely impact the companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition.19item 1a. risk factorsoperational related risk factorssales of the companys products and services are dependent on its ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified sales associates, brokers and employees in the u.s. and sales associates and other distribution partners in japan.the companys sales, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if its sales networks deteriorate or if the company does not adequately provide support, training and education for its existing network of sales associates, brokers, other distribution partners and employees. in the u.s., competition exists for sales associates and brokers with demonstrated ability. further, low rates of unemployment, such as those currently reflected in the u.s. employment market, tend to make it more difficult for aflac u.s. to maintain its network of sales associates. in japan, the companys sales results are dependent upon its relationship with sales associates and other distribution partners, including japan post group. sales of aflac japan cancer products in the japan post group channel experienced a material decline beginning in august 2019. while japan post group resumed proactive sales of cancer insurance policies in april 2021, the company can provide no assurance regarding the ultimate timing or extent of any recovery in such sales. it is uncertain what long term effect these developments will have on the companys results of operations or financial condition, but any such effects could be material. see the aflac japan segment section of item 7. md&a for additional information.the company competes with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis of its products, compensation, support services and financial rating. the companys sales associates, brokers and other distribution partners are independent contractors and may sell products of its competitors. if the companys competitors offer products that are more attractive, or pay higher commissions than the company does, any or all of these distribution partners may concentrate their efforts on selling the companys competitors products instead of the companys. in addition to the companys commissioned sales force in the u.s., aflac has expanded its sales leadership team to include a salaried sales force of over 200 market directors and broker sales professionals. the companys inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates, brokers and other distribution partners, including its alliance partners in japan, could have a material adverse effect on the companys sales, results of operations and financial condition.additionally, as the japan and u.s. employment markets continue to evolve, there is risk that the companys practices regarding attracting, developing, and retaining employees may not be fully effective. employees may leave the company or choose other employers over the company due to various factors, including a competitive labor market. although aflac u.s. has not experienced any material labor shortage to date, it has experienced elevated levels of workforce turnover and there has been an overall tightening of, and increased competition within, the u.s. labor market. these conditions, together with higher levels of inflation may result in increased operating expenses. a sustained labor shortage or continuing increased turnover rates within the aflac u.s. workforce, due to labor market factors or the state of the u.s. economy, could lead to increased costs of the day to day operation of the aflac u.s. business, the inability to hire and retain employees, or the outsourcing of certain operations. failure to successfully meet and maintain sufficient levels of employees may diminish the companys ability to achieve its financial and compliance objectives, both of which are time consuming and personnel intensive.if future policy benefits, claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves, the companys financial results would be adversely affected.the assumptions and estimates that the company uses in establishing premiums and reserves depend on the companys judgment regarding the likelihood of future events and are inherently uncertain. many factors can cause actual outcomes to deviate from these assumptions and estimates, such as changes in incidence rates, economic conditions, changes in government healthcare policy, advances in medical technology, changes in treatment patterns, and changes in average lifespan. accordingly, the company cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that it will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level the company assumes prior to payment of benefits or claims. if the companys actual experience is different from its assumptions or estimates, the companys premiums and reserves may prove inadequate. reserve assumptions are regularly reviewed by the company and may be revised if future expectations change. these experience deviations and assumption updates could have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.20item 1a. risk factorsthe success of the companys business depends in part on effective information technology systems, on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, and on successful execution of revenue growth and expense management initiatives.the companys business depends in large part on its technology systems for interacting with employers, policyholders, sales associates, and brokers, and the companys business strategy involves providing customers with easy to use products to meet their needs and ensuring employees have the technology in place to support those needs. some of the companys information technology systems and software are older, legacy type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards including adequate business continuity procedures. as such, the company is investing in technology and other capabilities to continuously enhance its customer experience, while also seeking to increase efficiencies. the company is also developing new and innovative products and enhancing existing products. the company will continue to incur expenses related to, among other things, investments in digital capabilities and product innovation including the development and use of artificial intelligence (ai). the companys development of new technology, including the use of ai by the company and third party vendors, could lead to an increased risk of a business interruption or a cybersecurity breach. further, the companys long term strategy depends on successful operational execution and its ability to execute on its transformational initiatives, including investments in technology and other initiatives intended to grow revenue and control expenses, combined with its ability to achieve efficiencies and attract and retain personnel. if the company does not maintain the effectiveness of its systems and continue to develop and enhance information systems that support its business processes in a cost efficient manner, the companys sales, business retention, operations and reputation could be adversely affected and it could be exposed to litigation, regulatory proceedings and fines or penalties.interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm the companys business. the company stores confidential policyholder, employee, agent, broker, and other proprietary information on its information technology systems. the company also depends heavily on its telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data it uses to run its businesses and service its customers. the companys information technology and other systems, as well as those of third party providers and participants in the companys distribution channels, have been and will likely continue to be subject to physical or electronic break ins, unauthorized tampering, security breaches, social engineering, phishing, web application attacks, computer viruses or other malicious codes, or other cyber related attacks, that may result in the failure to adequately maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity, or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers and prospective customers, or in the misappropriation of the companys intellectual property or proprietary information. the risk of a cyber incident impacting business operations has grown as third parties continue to develop new and highly sophisticated methods of attack. the company and its third parties or vendors have and may continue to experience outages or cyberattacks that disrupt the operations or impact the confidentiality, availability or integrity of information, which may result in operational, legal, regulatory or financial harm. furthermore, depending upon the type of attack, it could impact the confidentiality, integrity and or availability of it systems and data, disrupting business operations and resulting in the loss of consumer confidence. although the company attempts to manage its exposure to such events through the purchase of cyber liability insurance, such events are inherently unpredictable, and insurance may not be sufficient to protect the company against all losses. as a result, events such as these could adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operation. although the minor data leakage issues the company has experienced to date have not had a material effect on its business, there is no assurance that the companys security systems or processes will prevent or mitigate future break ins, tampering, security breaches or other cyber related attacks. as the company pursues it transformation and increased cloud adoption, it inherently exposes the company to potential cyber related attacks. interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by the company or others, including third party providers and participants in the companys distribution channels, could delay or disrupt the companys ability to do business and service its customers, seriously harm the companys brand, reputation, and ability to compete effectively, subject it to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect the companys business. in addition, the costs to address or remediate system interruptions or security threats and vulnerabilities, whether before or after an incident, could be significant.21item 1a. risk factorsas a holding company, the parent company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.the parent company is a holding company and has no direct operations, and its most significant assets are the stock of its subsidiaries. because the parent company conducts its operations through its operating subsidiaries, the parent company depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its debt service and other obligations, to pay dividends on and conduct repurchases of its common stock, and to make investments into its subsidiaries or external opportunities.aflac is domiciled in nebraska and is subject to insurance regulations that impose certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by aflac to the parent company. the nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. the nebraska insurance department also must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. after the japan branch conversion, the nebraska insurance department and the fsa approved their respective domiciled insurance company service arrangements and transactions. the fsa does not allow dividends or other payments from aflac japan unless it meets certain financial criteria as governed by japanese corporate law. under these criteria, dividend capacity at the japan subsidiary will be defined as retained earnings plus other capital reserve less net after tax net unrealized losses on available for sale securities. the ability of aflac and aflac japan to pay dividends or make other payments to the parent company could also be constrained by the companys dependency on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. the companys ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on aflacs capitalization level. any inability of aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the parent company could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations.for the foregoing reasons, there is no assurance that the earnings from, or other available assets of, the parent companys operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to enable the company to operate.the companys risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave the company exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect the companys businesses or result in losses.the company has developed an enterprise wide risk management and governance framework to mitigate risk and loss to the company. the company maintains policies, procedures and controls intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the risks to which the company is exposed. however, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because risk may exist, or emerge in the future, that the company has not appropriately anticipated or identified. if the companys risk management framework proves ineffective, the company may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. as the companys businesses change and the markets in which it operates evolve, the companys risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes, and risks may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. in times of market stress, unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience resulting from greater than expected morbidity, mortality, longevity, or persistency, the effectiveness of the companys risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses to the company. under difficult or less liquid market conditions, the companys risk management strategies may be ineffective or more difficult or expensive to execute because other market participants may be using the same or similar strategies to manage risk.many of the companys risk management strategies or techniques are based upon historical customer and market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. the company cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework, including the underlying assumptions or strategies, will be accurate and effective. management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies, procedures and controls to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies, procedures and controls may not be fully effective. the companys businesses and corporate areas primarily use models to project future cash flows associated with pricing products, calculating reserves and valuing assets, and evaluating risk and determining capital requirements, among other uses. these models are utilized under a risk management policy approved by the companys executive risk management committees, however, the models may not operate properly and rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. as the companys businesses continue to grow and evolve, the number and 22item 1a. risk factorscomplexity of models the company utilizes expands, increasing the companys exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data and assumptions.past or future misconduct by the companys employees or employees of third parties (suppliers which are cost based relationships and alliance partners which are revenue generating relationships) could result in violations of law by the company, regulatory sanctions and or serious reputational or financial harm, and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. despite the companys published supplier code of conduct, due diligence of the companys alliance partners, and rigorous contracting procedures (including financial, legal, it security, ai and risk reviews), there can be no assurance that controls and procedures that the company employs will be effective. additionally, the use of third parties also poses operational risks that could result in financial loss, operational disruption, brand damage, or compliance issues. inadequate oversight of the companys third party suppliers due to the lack of policies, procedures, training and governance may lead to financial loss or damage to the aflac brand.the use of third party vendors to support the companys operations makes the company susceptible to the operational risk of those third parties, which could lower revenues, increase costs, reduce profits, disrupt business, or damage the companys reputation.the company utilizes third party vendors to provide certain business support services and functions, which exposes the company to risks outside the control of the company that may lead to business disruptions. the reliance on these third party vendors creates a number of business risks, such as the risk that the company may not maintain service quality, control or effective management of the outsourced business operations and that the company cannot control the information systems, facilities or networks of such third party vendors. additionally, the company is at risk of being unable to meet legal, regulatory, financial or customer obligations if the information systems, facilities or networks of a third party vendor are disrupted, damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as fire, natural disaster, pandemic or power outage, or due to cybersecurity incidents, ransomware or other impacts to vendors, including labor strikes, political unrest and terrorist attacks. since certain third party vendors conduct operations for the company outside the u.s., the political and military events in foreign jurisdictions could have an adverse impact on the companys outsourced operations. the company may be adversely affected by a third party vendor who operates in a poorly controlled manner or fails to deliver contracted services, which could lower revenues, increase costs, reduce profits, disrupt business, or damage the companys reputation.regulatory risk factorstax rates applicable to the company may change. the company is subject to taxation in japan, and in the u.s. under federal and numerous state and local tax jurisdictions. in preparing the companys financial statements, the company estimates the amount of tax that will become payable, but the companys effective tax rate may be different than estimates due to numerous factors including accounting for income taxes, the mix of earnings from japan and the u.s., the results of tax audits, adjustments to the value of uncertain tax positions, changes to estimates and other factors. further, changes in u.s. or japan tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase the companys corporate taxes and reduce earnings.in addition, it remains difficult to predict the timing and effect that future tax law changes could have on the companys earnings both in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions, including in connection with the current presidential administrations continuing interest in raising revenue from the corporate sector in the u.s. any of these factors could cause the company to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or the companys current estimates. if the companys effective tax rate were to increase, the companys financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if the company fails to comply with restrictions on customer privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that its third party service providers and business associates who access, store, process or transmit sensitive customer information maintain its security, integrity, confidentiality and availability, the companys reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.the collection, maintenance, use, protection, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by the companys businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. with regard to personal information obtained from policyholders, the insured, or others, aflac japan is regulated in japan by the appi and guidelines issued by fsa and other governmental authorities.23item 1a. risk factorsvarious state laws in the u.s. address the unauthorized access and acquisition of personal information and the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. hipaa requires the company to impose privacy and security requirements on its business associates (as such term is defined in the hipaa regulations). several states including california and new york, in which aflac u.s. conducts significant portions of its business, have made changes to their privacy or cybersecurity laws or regulations in recent years. further, the u.s. congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to the companys business. compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on the companys business models, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by the companys business associates. they also may impose further restrictions on the companys collection, disclosure and use of customer identifiable data that are housed in one or more of the companys administrative databases. noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, theft or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information, whether by the company or by one of its third parties, could have a material adverse effect on the companys business, reputation, brand and results of operations, including: material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages; consent orders regarding the companys privacy and security practices; adverse actions against the companys licenses to do business; and injunctive relief.in addition, under japanese laws and regulations, including the appi, if a leak or loss of personal information by aflac japan or its business associates should occur, depending on factors such as the volume of personal data involved and the likelihood of other secondary damage, aflac japan may be required to file reports to the fsa; issue public releases explaining such incident to the public; or become subject to an fsa business improvement order, which could pose a risk to the companys reputation.although the company provides for appropriate protections through its contracts and performs information security risk assessments of its third party service providers and business associates, the company still has limited control over their actions and practices. in addition, despite the security measures the company has in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, the companys facilities and systems, and those of the companys third party providers and participants in its distribution channels may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and or human errors or other similar events. from time to time, the company, its third party providers and participants in the companys distribution channels have experienced and will likely continue to experience such events. in such cases, notification to affected individuals, state and federal regulators, state attorneys general and media may be required, depending upon the number of affected individuals and whether personal information including health or financial data was subject to unauthorized access.extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth.the companys insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental authorities, that exercise a degree of interpretive latitude, including the fsa and ministry of finance (mof) in japan, state insurance regulators, the bma in bermuda, the sec, the naic, the fio, the u.s. department of justice, state attorneys general, the u.s. commodity futures trading commission, and the u.s. department of the treasury, including the internal revenue service (irs), in the u.s. the company is subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may result in non compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. further, regulatory authorities periodically re examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations. in july 2023, new regulations were proposed by the u.s. departments of labor, treasury and health and human services related to (i) short term, limited duration insurance, (ii) fixed indemnity and hospital indemnity excepted benefits, (iii) specified disease or illness excepted benefits, and (iv) tax treatments of fixed amounts received through employment based accident or health insurance. the timing and substance of the final regulations, if any, is not known, but if passed in the proposed form, these regulations could materially affect sales of aflac u.s.additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of an issue changing, cause the company to change its views regarding the actions it needs to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective. this may necessitate changes to the companys practices that may, in some cases, limit its ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of the companys business. 24item 1a. risk factorsif the companys subsidiaries fail to meet the minimum capital or operational requirements established by its respective regulators, they could be subject to examination or corrective action, or the companys financial strength ratings could be downgraded, or both. compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase the companys direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations. for additional information, see the government regulation subsections of item 1. business. general risk factorscompetition could adversely affect the companys ability to increase or maintain its market share or profitability.the company operates in a competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative reform, marketing practices and changes to health care and health insurance delivery. these factors require the company to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate the companys products and services from those of its competitors. the company also faces potential competition from existing or new companies in the u.s. and japan that have not historically been active in the supplemental health insurance industry, but some of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than the company. further, some of these potential competitors could introduce new means of product development and delivery that disrupt the companys business model. failure to anticipate market trends and or to differentiate the companys products and services can affect the companys ability to retain or grow profitable lines of business. further, as employers and brokers are increasingly requesting a full suite of products from one insurance provider, a failure to react and adapt to these demands could result in decreased sales or market share.the companys future success will depend, in part, on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for the companys products and services and to create additional efficiencies in its operations. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. a failure to meet evolving customer demands through innovative product development, effective distribution channels, and continuous investment in the companys technology could adversely affect the companys operating results. further, the evolving fragmentation of media and marketing channels that has developed over recent years could weaken the impact of the companys advertising efforts over time. as a result, the companys ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and its business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.catastrophic events, including those as a result of climate change or major public health issues, could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations as well as the availability of the companys infrastructure and systems.the companys insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events including, but not necessarily limited to, epidemics, pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, war or other military action, major public health issues and terrorism or other acts of violence. claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in the companys financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce its profitability or harm the companys financial condition, as well as affect its ability to write new business. in addition, such events may lead to periods of voluntary or required premium grace periods, which may lead to volatility in lapse rates and related premiums. any resulting or coincidental economic effects could impact the companys business, financial condition, results of operations, capital position, liquidity or prospects in a number of ways. these catastrophic events may cause changes to estimates of future earnings, capital deployment and other guidance the company has provided to the markets in the 2024 outlook section of item 7. md&a.additionally, the companys operations, as well as those of its vendors, service providers and counterparties, may be adversely affected by such catastrophic events to the extent they disrupt the companys physical infrastructure, human resources or systems that support its businesses and customers. although the company has a global crisis management framework to minimize the business disruption from a catastrophic event, such framework may not be effective to avoid an adverse impact to the company from such an event. while the assessment of risks related to climate change are part of the companys credit review process, climate change related risks may adversely impact the value of the securities that the company holds. climate change may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and forest fires. further, the company cannot predict the effects that any legal or regulatory changes made in response to climate change concerns or major public health issues would have on the companys business.25item 1a. risk factorsevents, including those external to the companys operations, could damage the companys reputation.the company has made significant investments in the aflac brand over a long period of time. because insurance products are intangible, the companys ability to compete for and maintain policyholders relies to a large extent on consumer trust in the companys business, including its alliance partners, sales associates and other distribution partners. the perception of unfavorable business practices or financial weakness with respect to the company, its alliance partners, sales associates or other distribution partners could create doubt regarding the companys ability to honor the commitments it has made to its policyholders. such perceptions could also negatively impact the companys ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates, brokers and other distribution partners, including its alliance partners in japan, and could have a material adverse effect on the companys sales, results of operations and financial condition. these effects could also result from a perception of a lack of commitment to sustainability efforts and attention to societal impacts, unfavorable positions on items of public policy, or from failure to make progress toward the companys sustainability goals. maintaining the companys stature as a trustworthy insurer and responsible corporate citizen, which helps support the strength of the companys brand, is critical to the companys reputation and the failure or perceived failure to do so could adversely affect the companys brand value, financial condition and results of operations. the company depends heavily on key management personnel, and the loss of services of one or more of its key executives could harm the companys business.the companys success depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of its key management personnel. the loss of the services of one or more of the companys senior executives could significantly undermine its management expertise, and the companys business could be adversely affected.changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standard boards (fasb) or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the companys financial statements.the companys financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and or expanded. accordingly, from time to time the company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb. changes to accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition. for additional information, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.the company faces risks related to litigation, regulatory investigations and inquiry and other matters.the company is a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. the final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and plaintiffs may seek very large amounts in class actions or other litigation. although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, the company believes the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, a substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against the company, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm the companys reputation, result in changes in operations, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant costs due to legal fees, settlements or judgments against the company, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the companys business, financial condition and results of operations. without limiting the foregoing, the litigation and regulatory matters the company is, has been, or may become, subject to include matters related to sales agent recruiting, policy sales practices, claim payments and procedures including denial or delay of benefits, the low level of aflac u.s. benefit ratios in recent financial periods, material misstatements or omissions in the companys financial reports or other public statements, and or corporate governance, corporate culture or business ethics matters. further, the company may be subject to claims of or litigation regarding sexual or other forms of misconduct or harassment, or discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, or other bases, notwithstanding that the companys code of business conduct and ethics prohibits such harassment and discrimination by its employees, the company has ongoing training programs and provides opportunities to report claims of noncompliant conduct, and it investigates and may take disciplinary action regarding alleged harassment or discrimination. any violations of or deviation from laws, regulations, internal or external codes or standards of normative behavior, or perceptions of such violations or deviations, by the companys employees or by independent sales agents could adversely impact the companys reputation and brand value, financial condition and results of operations.26item 1a. risk factorsallegations or determinations of agent misclassification could adversely affect the companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.a majority of the companys u.s. sales force is, and has historically been, comprised of independent agents. while the company believes that it has properly classified such agents as independent contractors, the company may be subject to claims, regulatory action by state or federal departments of labor or tax authorities, changes in state or federal law, or litigation asserting that such agents are employees. the laws and regulations governing the classification of workers in the u.s. may be changed or interpreted differently compared to past interpretations, including in states where the company generates significant sales through independent agents. an allegation or determination that independent agents in the companys u.s. sales force have been misclassified as independent contractors could result in changes in the companys operations and u.s. business model, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant costs due to legal fees, settlements or judgments against the company, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.item 1b. unresolved staff commentsnot applicable.item 1c. cybersecuritydue to the ever changing cybersecurity landscape, the companys board of directors has adopted an information security policy directing management to establish and operate a global information security program with the goals of identifying, assessing and monitoring existing and emerging cybersecurity threats and ensuring that the companys information assets and data, and the data of its customers, are appropriately protected from loss or theft. the board has delegated oversight of the companys information security program to the audit and risk committee. the companys senior officers, including its global security and chief information security officer (gsciso), are responsible for the operation of the global information security program and communicate quarterly with the audit and risk committee on the program, including with respect to the state of the program, compliance with applicable regulations, risks associated with current and evolving threats, and recommendations for changes in the information security program. the global information security program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan that is designed to provide a management framework across company functions for a coordinated assessment and response to potential security incidents. this framework establishes a protocol to report certain incidents to the gsciso and other senior officers, with the goal of timely assessing such incidents, determining applicable disclosure requirements and communicating with the audit and risk committee. the incident response plan directs the executive officers to report certain incidents immediately and directly to the lead non management director or the chair of the audit and risk committee. the above framework tracks and allows team members to monitor each incident throughout its lifecycle to ensure the company is informed about and following cybersecurity incidents as they are mitigated and remediated. post incident reviews are also performed to determine if there are any additional controls that may feasibly be implemented to prevent recurrence.as a part of the global information security program, an enterprise cybersecurity risk assessment is performed annually in coordination with the gsciso to identify and assess material cybersecurity risks and mitigating controls. the assessment results are incorporated into a risk register managed by the companys overall enterprise risk management group to integrate the risks into the overall risk management processes. the company engages with independent firms to conduct operational control assessments, which cover information protection. every three years, the company engages independent consultants specifically for cyber matters. additionally, the company performs third party risk assessments to evaluate security controls and identify inherent and residual risks associated with third party engagements. issues identified during third party risk assessments are documented and escalated to company management through an established committee structure based on the risk ratings associated with each issue. the company also utilizes professionals from the companys legal team and gscisos leadership team, a majority of whom have specialized skills and knowledge in cybersecurity risk management based on their prior work experience and relevant industry certifications, such as certified information systems security professional and certified information security manager, to assist in assessing cybersecurity risks, materiality of cybersecurity incidents and disclosures of the same. specifically, the gsciso has security experience in the public sector and private sector financial services industry holding positions in areas such as business continuity, information assurance, and technology risk management as well as being a certified information systems security professional, certified information security manager and certified project 27item 1b. unresolved staff commentsmanager as well as being certified in risk and information systems control. the gsciso and his direct reports have an average of approximately 23 years of experience in the field of cybersecurity.see item 1a. risk factors for the risk factor titled "interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm the companys business" for additional information regarding how the companys business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by risks from cybersecurity threats.item 2. propertiesin tokyo, japan, the company has two primary campuses. the first campus includes a building, owned by the company, for the customer call center, the claims department, the information technology departments, and training facility. this campus also includes a leased property, which houses aflac japans policy administration and customer service departments. the second campus comprises leased office space, which serves as aflac japans headquarters and houses administrative and investment support functions. the company also leases additional office space in tokyo, along with regional offices located throughout the country. in the u.s., the company owns land and buildings that comprise two primary campuses located in columbus, georgia. these campuses include buildings that serve as the companys worldwide headquarters and house administrative support and information technology functions for u.s. operations. the company leases office space in columbia, south carolina, which houses the companys caic subsidiary (branded as aflac group insurance); in new york, new york, which houses the companys global investment division; in tampa, florida, which houses the companys abs subsidiary; and in farmington, connecticut, windsor, connecticut and plantation, florida, which houses the operations of the companys group life, disability and absence management business. the company leases other administrative office space throughout the u.s., puerto rico, the united kingdom, and bermuda.the company believes its properties are adequate and suitable for its business as currently conducted and are adequately maintained.item 3. legal proceedingsthe company is a defendant in various lawsuits and receives various regulatory inquiries considered to be in the normal course of business. members of the companys senior legal and financial management teams review litigation and regulatory inquiries on a quarterly and annual basis. the final results of any litigation or regulatory inquiries cannot be predicted with certainty. although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, the company believes the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.item 4. mine safety disclosuresnot applicable.28item 5. market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer

this md&a for a definition of this non u.s. gaap financial measure.industry trends the company is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight and a variety of trends that affect the industries where it competes.financial and economic environmentthe companys business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on the company, in part because the company has a large investment portfolio and its insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. see item 1a. risk factors for the risk factor entitled, "difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on the companys investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm the companys business."33item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations demographicsaflac japan segmentwith japans aging population and the rise in healthcare costs, supplemental health care insurance products remain attractive. however, due to the aging population and decline in birthrate, new opportunities for customer demographics are not as readily available. japans existing customers and potential customers seek products that are easily understood, cost effective and can be accessed through technology enabled devices.aflac u.s. segmentcustomer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different customer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. customer expectations and preferences are changing. trends indicate existing customers and potential customers seek cost effective solutions that are easily understood and can be accessed through technology enabled devices. additionally, income protection and the health needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry.regulatory environmentsee item 1. business aflac japan government regulation and aflac u.s. government regulation for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the company and the associated risks.competitive environmentsee item 1. business aflac japan competitive markets and aflac u.s. competitive markets for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which the company competes in each of its segments.2024 outlook the companys strategy to drive long term shareholder value is to pursue growth through product development and distribution expansion and to achieve efficiencies by modernizing its technology and streamlining its operations.the companys objectives in 2024 are to maintain strong pretax margins with increased sales production through product refreshment in its aflac japan segment and to begin realizing benefits from its buy to build initiatives and other platform investments, manage expenses and strengthen the number of career agents for aflac u.s. the company believes that its strategy of positioning itself for future growth and efficiency while defending and leveraging its market leading position, powerful brand recognition and diverse distribution in japan and the u.s. will provide support toward these objectives.in november 2023, the board of directors announced a 19.0% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, effective with the first quarter of 2024. the company intends to maintain strong capital ratios in aflac japan and aflac u.s. in support of its commitment to shareholder dividends while remaining tactical in its deployment of capital in the form of share repurchases and opportunistic investments. the company intends to maintain a minimum smr of 500% for aflac japan and a target combined rbc over time of approximately 400% for aflac u.s., consistent with the companys risk management practices.aflac japan segmentfor aflac japan, the company anticipates that favorable morbidity experience and the shift in premiums over the last several years from first sector savings products to third sector cancer and medical products and first sector protection products will result in stable benefit ratios in the aflac japan segment, while expense reduction efforts are expected to reduce expense ratios. the company expects that benefit and expense ratios will continue to experience some level of revenue pressure due to the impact of paid up policies and internal reinsurance transactions. for 2024, the company expects aflac japan to generate a benefit ratio in the range of 66% to 68% and an expense ratio in the range of 19% to 21%.aflac u.s. segmentfor aflac u.s., the company expects growth in life and disability as well as dental and vision to increase benefit ratios and decrease expense ratios over time. for 2024, the company expects aflac u.s. to generate a benefit ratio in the range of 45% to 47% and an expense ratio in the range of 38% to 40%.34item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate and otherthe company expects corporate and other results to reflect stable net investment income in 2024, as compared with 2023, assuming that u.s. interest rates remain stable and excluding the impact of tax credit investments, as tax benefits are recognized in a corresponding lower income tax expense.for important disclosures applicable to statements made in this 2024 outlook, please see the statement on forward looking information at the beginning of item 1. business, the risk factors identified in item 1a. and this item 7. md&a.results of operationsthe company earns its revenues principally from insurance premiums and investments. the companys operating expenses primarily consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing its products. profitability for the company depends principally on its ability to price its insurance products at a level that enables the company to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products. profitability also depends on, among other items, actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance products, and the companys ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize tax capacity, and manage expenses. this document includes references to the companys financial performance measures which are not calculated in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) (non u.s. gaap). the financial measures exclude items that the company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.due to the size of aflac japan, where the functional currency is the japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. in periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. a significant portion of the companys business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for u.s. gaap reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a u.s. gaap basis. management evaluates the companys financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency neutral operating performance over time. the average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published mufg bank, ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (ttm).the company defines the non u.s. gaap financial measures included in this document as follows:adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. the adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside managements control. adjusted revenues are u.s. gaap total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. adjusted expenses are u.s. gaap total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the companys insurance operations and that do not reflect the companys underlying business performance. management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the companys insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the companys insurance business. the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from 35item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. the company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside managements control, while excluding the components that are within managements control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses.amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the companys japan segment or in corporate and other. these amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the hedge. the company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. there is no comparable u.s. gaap financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. the company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the companys business is conducted in japan and foreign exchange rates are outside managements control; therefore, the company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily japanese yen) into u.s. dollars. the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively. adjusted book value is the u.s. gaap book value (representing total shareholders equity), less aoci as recorded on the u.s. gaap balance sheet. adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. the company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude aoci, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside managements control. the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders equity, excluding aoci. the company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of aoci, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside managements control. the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is return on average equity (roe) as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders equity.u.s. dollar denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact represents amounts excluding foreign currency impact on u.s. dollar denominated investment income using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period. the company considers u.s. dollar denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact important as it eliminates the impact of foreign currency changes on the aflac japan segment results, which are outside managements control. the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure for u.s. dollar denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact is the corresponding net investment income amount from the u.s. dollar denominated investments translated to yen.36item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

investment strategy is to invest primarily in fixed maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the companys profitability. this investment strategy incorporates asset liability matching (alm) to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the companys liability structure. the company does not purchase securities with the intent of generating investment gains or losses. however, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and or general portfolio management and rebalancing. the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of the companys insurance products. net investment gains and losses excluded from adjusted earnings include the following: securities transactions credit losses changes in the fair value of equity securitiescertain derivative and foreign currency activities.37item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securities transactions, credit losses and changes in the fair value of equity securitiessecurities transactions include gains and losses from sales and redemptions of investments where the amount received is different from the amortized cost of the investment. credit losses include losses for held to maturity fixed maturity securities, available for sale fixed maturity securities, loan receivables, loan commitments and reinsurance recoverables. changes in the fair value of equity securities are the result of gains or losses driven by fluctuations in market prices.certain derivative and foreign currency activitiesthe companys derivative activities include:foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk on u.s. dollar denominated investments in aflac japans portfolio, with options used on a standalone basis and or in a collar strategy;foreign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen and hedge the companys long term exposure to a weakening yen;cross currency interest rate swaps, also referred to as foreign currency swaps, associated with certain senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency swaps that are associated with variable interest entity (vie) bond purchase commitments, and investments in special purpose entities, including vies where the company is the primary beneficiary;interest rate swaps used to economically hedge interest rate fluctuations in certain variable rate investments;interest rate swaptions used to hedge changes in the fair value associated with interest rate fluctuations for certain u.s. dollar denominated available for sale fixed maturity securities; andbond purchase commitments at the inception of investments in consolidated vies.gains and losses are recognized as a result of valuing these derivatives, net of the effects of hedge accounting. the company also excludes from adjusted earnings the accounting impacts of remeasurement associated with changes in the foreign currency exchange rate. for additional information regarding net investment gains and losses, including details of reported amounts for the periods presented, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.other and non recurring itemsthe u.s. insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. the system can result in periodic charges to the company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. these charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the companys business nor reflect the companys underlying business performance, but result from external situations not controlled by the company. the company excludes any charges associated with u.s. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from adjusted earnings.in japan, the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however, these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the u.s. in japan, these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies, but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. based on this structure, the company does not remove the japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings.the company considers the costs associated with the early redemption of its debt to be unrelated to the underlying fundamentals and trends in its insurance operations. additionally, these costs are driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the debt, and the company considers these interest rate changes to represent economic conditions not directly associated with its insurance operations. in may 2021, the parent company used a portion of the net proceeds from its april 2021 issuance of various series of senior notes to redeem $700 million of its 3.625% senior notes due june 2023. the pretax expense due to the early redemption of these notes was $48 million.38item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in june 2023, the company amended the u.s. defined benefit plan to freeze future benefits under the plan for all participants effective january 1, 2024, which resulted in the company recognizing a curtailment gain of approximately $49 million in 2023. the curtailment gain is both unusual and non recurring and is unrelated to other recurring benefit costs associated with the plan; therefore, the company has excluded the curtailment gain from adjusted earnings.in 2023, other items excluded from adjusted earnings included an impairment for certain finite lived intangible assets of approximately $11 million as a result of the company exiting the third party administration business acquired in connection with the purchase of aflac benefit solutions, inc. in 2019. the impairment of these intangible assets are not related to the ongoing operations of the business and occur infrequently; therefore, the company has excluded the impairment from adjusted earnings. in 2021, other items excluded from adjusted earnings included integration costs related to the companys acquisition of zurich north americas u.s. corporate life and pensions business; these costs primarily consisted of expenditures for legal, accounting, consulting, integration of systems and processes and other similar services. these integration costs were excluded from adjusted earnings for one year following the acquisition and amounted to $26 million for the year ended december 31, 2021.income taxes the companys combined u.s. and japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 11.5% in 2023, 9.3% in 2022 and 18.7% in 2021. in 2023, the combined effective tax rate differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to historic and solar tax credits and the exclusion of foreign currency translation gains and losses held in the delaware statutory trust. in 2022, the combined effective tax rate differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the tax accounting method change discussed below, as well as historic and solar tax credits. in 2021, the combined effective tax rate differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to historic and solar tax credits. total income taxes were $603 million in 2023, $451 million in 2022 and $977 million in 2021. japanese income taxes on aflac japans results account for most of the companys consolidated income tax expense. aflac japan holds certain u.s. dollar denominated assets in a delaware statutory trust (dst). these assets are mostly comprised of various u.s. dollar denominated commercial mortgage loans. the functional currency of the dst for u.s. tax purposes was historically the japanese yen. in 2022, the company requested a change in tax accounting method through the internal revenue services automatic consent procedures to change the functional currency of the dst for u.s. tax purposes to the u.s. dollar. as a result, foreign currency translation gains or losses on assets held in the dst are no longer recognized for u.s. tax purposes. the company historically recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign currency translation gains on the dst assets, which was released in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of the functional currency change. the release of the deferred tax liability resulted in the company recognizing an income tax benefit of $174 million in 2023 and $452 million in 2022.in august 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) was signed into u.s. law, which among other things, imposed a 1% excise tax on the companys repurchases of its common stock. effective january 1, 2023, charges associated with the excise tax are recognized in equity consistent with other costs related to treasury stock.for additional information, see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting estimates income taxes section of this md&a.the company expects that its effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for future periods will be approximately 20%. the effective tax rate continues to be subject to future tax law changes both in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions. see the 39item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factor entitled "tax rates applicable to the company may change" in part i, item 1a. risk factors for additional information.foreign currency translationaflac japans premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen. aflac japan purchases yen denominated assets and u.s. dollar denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen denominated policy liabilities. yen denominated income statement accounts are translated to u.s. dollars using the weighted average japanese yen/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate for the reporting period, except realized gains and losses on securities transactions which are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. yen denominated balance sheet accounts are translated to u.s. dollars using the spot japanese yen/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.reconciliation of book value to adjusted book valuethe following table is a reconciliation of items impacting adjusted book value and adjusted book value per diluted share to the most directly

earnings (annualized) by average shareholders equity.(2) see separate reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted earnings above.(3) impact of foreign currency is calculated by restating all foreign currency components of the income statement to the weighted average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period. the impact is the difference of the restated adjusted earnings compared to reported adjusted earnings. for comparative purposes, only current period income is restated using the weighted average prior period exchange rate, which eliminates the foreign currency impact for the current period. this allows for equal comparison of this financial measure.results of operations by segmentu.s. gaap financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. furthermore, the company is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. the companys insurance business consists of two segments: aflac japan and aflac u.s. aflac japan is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. in addition, the parent company, other business units that are not individually reportable, and business activities, including reinsurance activities, not included in aflac japan or aflac u.s. are included in corporate and other. see item 1. business for a summary of each segments products and distribution channels. consistent with u.s. gaap guidance for segment reporting, pretax adjusted earnings is the companys u.s. gaap measure of segment performance. the company believes that a presentation of this measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of its business. additional performance measures used to evaluate the financial condition and performance of the companys segments are listed below. operating ratiosnew annualized

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in 2023, net earned premiums decreased primarily due to approximately 37 billion related to internal reinsurance transactions with aflac re and approximately 32 billion in limited pay products reaching premium paid up status. adjusted net investment income increased in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in floating rate income earned from u.s. dollar denominated investments, which was driven by higher yields, partially offset by lower income from make whole payments and an increase in amortized hedge cost. in 2023, total adjusted revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in net earned premiums and partially offset by an increase in adjusted net investment income. in 2023, total benefits and claims decreased primarily due to lower third sector incurred claims and annual assumption updates as well as an approximately 26 billion decrease due to internal reinsurance transactions with aflac re. total adjusted expenses decreased in 2023 primarily due to approximately 9 billion of impacts related to internal reinsurance transactions with aflac re and decreases related to expense control efforts. in 2023, pretax adjusted earnings increased primarily due to the decrease in total benefits and claims and total adjusted expenses, partially offset by the decrease in total adjusted revenues.in 2022, net earned premiums decreased primarily due to limited pay products reaching premium paid up status and terminations net of new issues. adjusted net investment income increased in 2022 primarily due to higher floating rate income earned from u.s. dollar denominated investments that were driven by stronger dollar exchange rates, increasing interest rates, and higher income from make whole payments received on called securities, which were partially offset by lower income from alternative assets and higher hedge costs. in 2022, total adjusted revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in net earned premiums. in 2022, total benefits and claims decreased primarily due to a larger reserve release related to "deemed hospitalization" benefits. total adjusted expenses decreased primarily due to lower general operating expenses. in 2022, pretax adjusted earnings increased primarily due to the decrease in total benefits and claims and total adjusted expenses, partially offset by the decrease in total adjusted revenues.when comparing 2021 results prior to and subsequent to adoption of ldti, net earned premiums decreased primarily due to approximately a 60 billion increase in the deferred profit liability on limited pay products as a result of the reclassification of the change in deferred profit liability from the benefits and claims, net line item to the net earned premiums line item. total benefits and claims decreased approximately 31 billion, which included a 7 billion reserve remeasurement gain. see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the adoption of ldti. annualized premiums in force at december 31, 2023, were 1.25 trillion, compared with 1.30 trillion in 2022 and 1.36 trillion in 2021. the decrease in annualized premiums in force in yen of 4.2% in 2023 was driven primarily by limited pay products reaching premium paid up status. the decrease in annualized premiums in force in yen of 4.4% in 2022 and 4.7% in 2021 was driven primarily by limited pay products reaching premium paid up status and lower sales as a result of pandemic conditions. annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates, were $8.8 billion in 2023, $9.8 billion in 2022 and $11.8 billion in 2021. as of december 31, 2023, aflac japan exceeded 22 million individual policies in force in japan, with more than 14 million cancer policies in force in japan.aflac japans investment portfolios include u.s. dollar denominated securities and reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). in years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total adjusted revenues, and pretax adjusted earnings in yen terms. in years when the yen weakens, translating u.s. dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total adjusted revenues, and pretax adjusted earnings in yen terms. 43item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table illustrates the effect of translating aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had foreign currency exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. amounts excluding foreign currency impact on u.s.

from annual updates to reserve assumptions, internal reinsurance activity, and the continued change in the mix of first and third sector business. the total adjusted expense ratio decreased in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in total adjusted revenues and an offsetting decrease in total adjusted expenses due to the internal reinsurance transactions with aflac re and expense control efforts. in total, the pretax adjusted profit margin increased in 2023, primarily due to the lower benefit ratio, the lower expense ratio and an offsetting decrease in total adjusted revenues.in 2022, the total benefits and claims to total premiums ratio decreased slightly primarily due to a larger reserve release related to "deemed hospitalization" benefits. the total adjusted expense ratio was essentially flat in 2022. in total, the pretax adjusted profit margin increased in 2022 primarily due to the lower benefit ratio, the lower expense ratio and an offsetting decrease in total adjusted

2023, the increase in new annualized premium sales on a yen basis was primarily driven by sales of aflac japans new cancer insurance product and updated first sector products, all of which were launched in the second half of 2022 and at japan post, dai ichi life and other financial institutions in the first half of 2023, and sales of aflac japans new medical insurance product launched in september 2023.in 2022, new annualized premium sales on a yen basis were essentially flat, compared with 2021, reflecting constrained sales in the first half of the year due to ongoing pandemic conditions offset by a new cancer product launch in certain distribution channels and first sector product updates in the second half of the year.the following table details the contributions to aflac

cost pressure on japans health care system, the company expects the need for third sector products will continue to rise in the future and that the medical and cancer insurance products aflac japan provides will continue to be an important part of its product portfolio. moreover, in november 2022, aflac japan refreshed its first sector savings type products ways and child endowment and began to actively promote sales of these products after having curtailed sales of both products beginning in 2013. the refreshment of these first sector products position aflac japan for potential future long term sales opportunities by marketing these products to a younger demographic as well as potential cross selling opportunities of aflac japans third sector products.sales of aflac japan cancer insurance products in the japan post group channel experienced a material decline beginning in august 2019. japan post group resumed proactive sales of cancer insurance policies in april 2021 and aflac japan continues to strengthen the strategic alliance. in april 2023, japan post group began selling aflac japans new cancer insurance product that was first launched in other channels in august 2022. in april 2022, approximately 10,000 employees of japan post co. were transferred to japan post insurance. japan post group has informed aflac japan that the transferred employees responsibilities will include sales of japan post insurance products and aflac japan cancer products but will not include sales of other financial products. for additional information, see the risk

of 10% of the parent companys outstanding shares or such shares representing 22.5% of the voting rights in the parent company.in light of the fact that the shares acquired by the trust, like all aflac incorporated common shares, will be eligible for 10 for 1 voting rights after being held for 48 consecutive months, the shareholders agreement further provides for voting restrictions that effectively limit the trustees voting rights to no more than 20% of the voting rights in the parent company and further restrict the trustees voting rights with respect to certain change in control transactions.

force included an average of approximately 6,200 u.s. agents, including brokers, who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. the company believes that this average weekly producer equivalent metric allows sales management to monitor progress and needs, as well as serve as a leading indicator of future production capacity. in july 2023, the u.s. department of labor, u.s. department of the treasury and u.s. department of health and human services issued a proposed joint rule that, as written, would impose significant limitations on the structure of benefits for hospital indemnity and other fixed indemnity plans, including those sold by aflac u.s. the current benefit structure for these products allows the company to vary the amount of benefits by the services or items received, severity of illness or injury, or any other characteristics particular to a course of treatment. if finalized in its current form, the proposed rule would eliminate aflac u.s.s ability to vary the amount of benefits provided by these products. in addition, the proposed rule also proposes to change the tax treatment of all fixed indemnity products. under the proposal, if premiums are paid on a pretax basis (either by the employer or by employee pretax salary reduction), then the entire amount of the benefit would be taxable income regardless of the amount of the employees unreimbursed medical expenses. currently, only the benefits received in excess of unreimbursed medical or medical related costs are subject to tax. the comment period for the proposed rule closed on september 11, 2023. aflac u.s. has filed comments opposing the proposed rule. the timing and substance of the final regulations, if any, is not known, and any such final rule could be the subject of litigation. aflac u.s. investmentsthe level of investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and

additional information on these investments.prior year amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of accounting guidance on january 1, 2023 related to accounting for long duration insurance contracts.in 2023, net earned premiums increased due to the internal reinsurance transactions between aflac japan and aflac re. adjusted net investment income decreased in 2023 primarily due to $252 million related to a higher volume of tax credit investments, as tax benefits are recognized in a corresponding lower income tax expense, partially offset by an increase driven by higher investment returns, $74 million related to internal reinsurance transactions between aflac japan and aflac re, and a $53 million increase in amortized hedge income. total adjusted revenues increased in 2023 primarily due to higher total premiums offset by lower adjusted net investment income. in 2023, total benefits and claims increased primarily due to $181 million related to the internal reinsurance transactions between aflac japan and aflac re and $163 million related to a novation agreement under which aflac re assumed the duties, obligations and liabilities through a reinsurance of business alij previously ceded to an external reinsurer, and partially offset by lower incurred claims. total adjusted expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to higher expenses associated with the internal reinsurance transactions between aflac japan and aflac re. pretax adjusted earnings decreased in 2023 primarily due to the increase in total adjusted revenue, which was offset by higher benefits and claims and the increase in total adjusted expenses.in 2022, net earned premiums decreased primarily due to significant yen weakening. adjusted net investment income increased primarily driven by higher investment returns, $47 million from a lower volume of tax credit investments, and an $11 million increase in amortized hedge income. total adjusted revenues increased primarily due to higher

claims. total adjusted expenses increased in 2022 primarily due to higher employee related expenses. pretax adjusted earnings increased in 2022 primarily due to the increase in total adjusted revenue, the decrease in total benefits and claims, and was partially offset by the increase in total adjusted expenses.the parent company invests in partnerships that specialize in rehabilitating historic structures or the installation of solar equipment in order to receive federal historic rehabilitation and solar tax credits. these investments are classified as limited partnerships and included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheets. the change in value of each investment is recorded as a reduction to net investment income. tax credits generated by these investments are recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of earnings. investmentsthe companys investment strategy utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking long term risk adjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives, and preserving shareholder value. in attempting to optimally balance these objectives, the company seeks to maintain on behalf of aflac japan a diversified portfolio of yen denominated investment assets, a u.s. dollar denominated investment portfolio hedged back to yen and a portfolio of unhedged u.s. dollar denominated assets. as part of the companys portfolio management and asset allocation process, aflac u.s. invests in fixed maturity investments and growth assets, including public equity securities and alternative investments in limited partnerships. aflac u.s. invests in both publicly traded and privately originated investment grade and below investment grade fixed maturity securities and loans. for additional information concerning the companys investments, see notes 3, 4, and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.the following tables detail

aflac re is eliminated in corporate and other in recent quarters, the company has noted a trend indicating a gradual strain in the valuations of the commercial real estate market in the united states, with specific concerns regarding office space. the company monitors this trend and its impact on the valuations of the companys transitional real estate loans (tres), commercial mortgage loans (cmls) and related underlying commercial properties.within the commercial mortgage and other loans category, the company has invested in a variety of loans including tres and cmls that are collateralized by commercial real estate, including some that are designed as office space. the company considers these investments to be well diversified by geography and among property types. further, the company believes that the portfolio is generally well positioned with exposures concentrated in high quality underlying properties with institutional investors who are positioned to manage their assets during periods of market volatility.the company has invested in certain tres that are currently in default of interest or maturity payments. the company continues to work with the borrowers to resolve these specific situations through loan continuance with potential modifications, or through the process of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. during 2023, the company took possession of certain commercial real estate properties securing defaulted loans through foreclosure and deed in lieu of foreclosure. properties acquired by the company through foreclosure and deed in lieu of foreclosure are reported as real estate owned (reo) in other investments in the consolidated balance sheet. the company utilizes third party asset managers to source, underwrite and manage each loan. the company closely monitors the activities of these managers. in the event that a loan workout is necessary, the company believes these external managers have the experience and resources to manage the process to maximize recovery.the company also monitors its commercial mortgage and other loan investments internally on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans credit quality indicators and payment status as current, past due, restructured or under foreclosure. see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning credit quality indicators, information on loans that are on nonaccrual status, and reo obtained through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. see also part i, item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of risk factors associated with the companys investments.55item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the ratings of the companys securities referenced in the table below are based on the ratings designations provided by major rating organizations such as moodys, standard & poors and fitch or, if not rated, are determined based on the companys internal analysis of such securities. when the ratings issued by the rating agencies differ, the company utilizes the second lowest rating when three or more rating agency ratings are available or the lowest rating when only two rating agency ratings are available. the distributions of fixed maturity securities the company owns, by credit rating, as of december 31 were as follows:composition of fixed maturity

declines in fair values can be a result of changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rate, and changes in net spreads driven by a broad market move or a change in the issuers underlying credit quality. the company believes these issuers have the ability to continue making timely payments of principal and interest. see the unrealized investment gains and losses section in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions and other corporate investments.below investment grade securitiesthe companys

downgraded to below investment gradethe company invests in middle market loans primarily to u.s. corporate borrowers, most of which have below investment grade ratings. the objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates and hedge costs through the acquisition of floating rate assets. the company maintains an allocation to higher yielding corporate bonds within the aflac japan and aflac u.s. portfolios. most of these securities were rated below investment grade at the time of purchase, but the company also purchased several that were rated investment grade which, because of market pricing, offer yields commensurate with below investment grade risk profiles. the objective of this allocation was to enhance the companys yield on invested assets and further diversify credit risk. all investments in this program must have a minimum rating at purchase of low bb using the companys above described rating methodology and are managed by the companys internal credit portfolio management team.57item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

dollarsaflac japan has a portfolio of privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on japanese government or other public corporate bonds. aflac japans investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non japanese issuers, are rated investment grade at purchase and have longer maturities, thereby allowing the company to improve asset/liability matching and overall investment returns. these securities are generally either privately negotiated arrangements or issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants were required. many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. these may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of the companys notes.hedging activitiesthe company uses derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. the company uses various strategies, including derivatives, to manage these risks. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information about market risk and the companys use of derivatives.derivatives are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while minimizing the impact on financial results. the companys derivatives programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for:a description of the companys derivatives, hedging strategies and underlying risk exposure.information about the notional amount and fair market value of the companys derivatives.the unrealized and realized gains and losses impact on adjusted earnings of derivatives in cash flow, fair value, net investments in foreign operations, or non qualifying hedging relationships.59item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign currency exchange rate risk hedge programthe company has deployed the following hedging strategies to mitigate exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk:aflac japan hedges u.s. dollar denominated investments back to yen (see aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated hedge program below).aflac japan maintains certain unhedged u.s. dollar denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of the companys investment in aflac japan (see aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated hedge program below).the parent company designates yen denominated liabilities (notes payable and loans) as non derivative hedging instruments and designates certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the companys net investment in aflac japan (see enterprise corporate hedging program below).the parent company enters into forward and option contracts to accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency exchange rate risk related to dividend payments by its subsidiary, alij, and reducing enterprise wide hedge costs (see enterprise corporate hedging program below).the following table presents metrics related to aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated hedge program and the parent companys enterprise corporate hedging program, including associated amortized hedge costs/income, for the years ended december 31. see the results

notional is reported net of any offsetting positions within aflac japan or the parent company, respectively.amortized hedge costs/income can fluctuate based upon many factors, including the derivative notional amount, the length of time of the derivative contract, changes in both u.s. and japan interest rates, and supply and demand for dollar funding. amortized hedge costs/income have fluctuated in recent periods due to changes in the previously mentioned factors.aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated hedge program (u.s. dollar program)aflac japan buys u.s. dollar denominated investments, typically corporate bonds, and hedges them back to yen with foreign currency forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. this economically creates yen assets that match yen liabilities during the life of the derivative and provides favorable capital treatment under the japan smr calculations. the currency risk being hedged is generally based on fair value of hedged investments. the following table summarizes the u.s. dollar denominated investments held by aflac japan as of december 31.60item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

lossesthe u.s. dollar program includes all u.s. dollar denominated investments in aflac japan other than the investments in certain consolidated vies where the instrument is economically converted to yen as a result of a derivative in the consolidated vie. the company uses one sided foreign currency put options to mitigate the settlement risk on u.s. dollar denominated assets related to extreme foreign currency rate changes. from time to time, aflac japan also maintains a collar program on a portion of its u.s. dollar program to mitigate against more extreme moves in foreign exchange and therefore support smr. as of december 31, 2023, there were no collars in aflac japan, and none of the companys foreign currency options hedging aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated assets were in the money. as of december 31, 2023, the fair value of aflac japans unhedged u.s. dollar denominated portfolio was $484 million (excluding certain u.s. dollar denominated assets shown in the table above as a result of consolidation that have been economically converted to yen using derivatives).foreign exchange derivatives used for hedging are periodically settled, which results in cash receipt or payment at maturity or early termination. the following table presents the settlements associated with the companys currency derivatives used for hedging aflac japans u.s. dollar denominated investments for the years ended december 31.(in millions)202320222021net cash inflows (outflows)$(598)$(757)$66 enterprise corporate hedging programthe company has designated certain yen denominated liabilities and foreign currency forwards and options of the parent company as accounting hedges of its net investment in aflac japan. the companys consolidated yen denominated net asset position was partially hedged at $6.8 billion as of december 31, 2023, with hedging instruments comprised of $3.7 billion of yen denominated debt and $3.1 billion of foreign currency forwards and options, compared with $11.6 billion as of december 31, 2022, with hedging instruments comprised of $4.0 billion of yen denominated debt and $7.6 billion of foreign currency forwards and options.the company makes its accounting designation of net investment hedge at the beginning of each quarter. if the total of the designated parent company non derivative and derivative notional is equal to or less than the companys net investment in aflac japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the currency exchange effect on the yen denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. the companys net investment hedge was effective during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. for additional information on the companys net investment hedging strategy, see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.in order to economically mitigate risks associated with the enterprise wide exposure to the yen and the level and volatility of hedge costs, the parent company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts. by buying u.s. dollars and 61item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selling yen, the parent company is effectively lowering its overall economic exposure to the yen, while aflac japans u.s. dollar exposure remains reduced as a result of aflac japans u.s. dollar program that economically creates yen assets. among other objectives, this strategy is intended to offset the enterprise wide amortized hedge costs by generating amortized hedge income. this activity is reported in corporate and other. the company continually evaluates the programs efficacy. as part of the companys internal reinsurance platform, aflac re enters into foreign currency forwards with the parent company, and may enter into such forwards with third parties, to economically manage the currency mismatch between aflac res assets, which are mostly denominated in u.s. dollars, and liabilities, which are mostly denominated in yen, in order to support and optimize bma capital requirements. for additional information on the companys internal reinsurance platform, see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of this md&a.interest rate risk hedge programaflac japan and aflac u.s. use interest rate swaps from time to time to mitigate the risk of investment income volatility for certain variable rate investments. in 2022, the company expanded the use of interest rate swaps for this hedging strategy. additionally, to manage interest rate risk associated with its u.s. dollar denominated investments held by aflac japan, from time to time the company utilizes interest rate swaptions. for additional discussion of the risks associated with the foreign currency exposure refer to the currency risk section in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and item 1a. specifically to the risk factors titled the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate and lack of availability of acceptable yen denominated investments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity." see note 4 of

protection corporationthe japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. legislation enacted regarding the framework of the life insurance policyholder protection corporation (lippc) included government fiscal measures supporting the lippc. in march 2022, japans diet passed legislation that extended the governments fiscal support of the lippc through march 2027. in march 2022, the lippc reached the required balance for the total life industry of 400 billion as specified by its articles of incorporation. as a result, additional contributions are not expected to be required unless the balance is reduced due to payments made by the lippc to the policyholders of insolvent insurers. accordingly, aflac japan did not recognize an expense for lippc assessments for the year ended december 31, 2023. aflac japan recognized an expense of .9 billion and 1.8 billion for lippc assessments for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.guaranty fund assessmentsunder u.s. state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. the amount of the guaranty fund assessment that an insurer is assessed is based on its proportionate share of premiums in that state. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on guaranty fund assessments. guaranty fund assessments for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were immaterial. liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company. capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the operations of the businesses, fund business growth and provide for an ability to withstand adverse circumstances. financial leverage (leverage) refers to an investment strategy of using debt to increase the potential roe. the company targets and actively manages liquidity, capital and leverage in the context of a number of considerations, including:business investment and growth needs strategic growth objectives financial flexibility and obligationscapital support for hedging activity a constantly evolving business and economic environment a balanced approach to capital allocation and shareholder deployment. the governance framework supporting liquidity, capital and leverage includes global senior management and board committees that review and approve all significant capital related decisions.the companys cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which have minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure. the target minimum amount for the parent companys cash and cash equivalents is approximately $1.8 billion to provide a capital buffer and liquidity support at the holding company. the company remains committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. at december 31, 2023, the company held $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents for stress conditions, which includes the parent companys target minimum amount of $1.8 billion. aflac japan and aflac u.s. generate cash flows from their operations and provide the primary sources of liquidity to the parent company through management fees and dividends, with aflac japan being the largest contributor. the primary uses of cash by the parent company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock, interest on its outstanding indebtedness and operating expenses.63item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table presents the amounts provided to the parent

conditions and with the goals of addressing the companys hedge costs and related potential need for collateral and mitigating against long term weakening of the japanese yen. further, the company plans to continue to maintain a portfolio of unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investments at aflac japan and to consider whether the amount of such investments should be increased or decreased relative to the companys view of economic equity surplus in aflac japan in light of potentially rising hedge costs and other factors. see the hedging activities subsection of this md&a for additional information. the company believes that its balance of cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy both its short term and long term cash requirements and plans for cash, including material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. in addition to cash and cash equivalents, the company also maintains credit facilities, both intercompany and with external partners, and a number of other available tools to support liquidity needs on a global basis. in september 2021, the parent company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that allows the company to issue an indefinite amount of debt securities, in one or more series, from time to time until september 2024. the company believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its notes payable and lines of credit at december 31, 2023. for additional information, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. as part of enterprise wide capital management and optimization, the company also utilizes the newly created intercompany reinsurance platform to execute internal reinsurance transactions with aflac re. for additional information, see note 8 of

companys experience on policy persistency, mortality, morbidity, and other assumptions. these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest, and future premium payments received from policyholders are not included. therefore, the sum of the cash outflows exceeds the corresponding liability amount. due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.(3) these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows exceeds the corresponding liability amount. for additional information on the companys major contractual obligations, see the applicable note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.the companys consolidated financial statements convey its financing arrangements during the periods presented. the company has not engaged in material intra period short term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in its balance sheet or disclosed therein. as of december 31, 2023, the company had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. the company has not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. see notes 1, 3, and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the companys securities lending and derivative activities. with the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes and the risk factors entitled, "the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate" and "lack of availability of acceptable yen denominated investments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity," the company is not aware of any trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in its liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount.consolidated cash flowsthe company consistently generates positive cash flows from operations, and has the ability to adjust cash flow management from other sources of liquidity including reinvestment cash flows and selling investments in order to meet short term cash needs.the company translates cash flows for aflac japans yen denominated items into u.s. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. in years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. 65item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended december 31.(in millions)202320222021operating activities$3,190 $3,879 $5,051 investing activities817 (1,540)(2,378)financing activities(3,723)(3,551)(2,739)exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents79 104 (24)net change in cash and cash equivalents$363 $(1,108)$(90)operating activitiesthe principal cash inflows for the companys insurance activities come from insurance premiums and investment income. the principal cash outflows are the result of policy claims, operating expenses, income tax, as well as interest expense. as a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. the company expects its future cash flows from premiums and investment portfolios to be sufficient to meet its cash needs for benefits and expenses. consolidated cash flow from operations decreased 17.8% in 2023, compared with 2022, and decreased 23.2% in 2022, compared with 2021.investing activitiesthe companys investment objectives provide for liquidity primarily through the purchase of publicly traded investment grade debt securities. prudent portfolio management dictates that the company attempts to match the duration of its assets with the duration of its liabilities. currently, when the companys fixed maturity securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. however, the long term nature of the companys business and its strong cash flows provide the company with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. from time to time or when market opportunities arise, the company disposes of selected fixed maturity securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and or re balance its portfolio. as a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year.as part of its overall corporate strategy, the company has committed $400 million to aflac ventures, llc (aflac ventures), as opportunities emerge. as of december 31, 2023, of the $400 million committed, approximately $281 million has been deployed. aflac ventures is a subsidiary of aflac global ventures, llc (aflac global ventures) which is reported in corporate and other. the central mission of aflac global ventures is to support the organic growth and business development needs of aflac japan and aflac u.s. with an emphasis on digital applications designed to improve the customer

business on february 21, 2024.68item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory restrictionsaflac japanaflac japan is required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by japanese corporate law in order to provide dividends to the parent company. under these criteria, dividend capacity at the japan subsidiary is basically defined as total equity excluding common stock and capital reserves (representing statutorily required amounts in japan) but reduced for net after tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities. these dividend capacity requirements are generally aligned with the smr. japans fsa maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the smr. aflac japans smr is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange rate changes; therefore, the company continues to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity, including the reduction of subsidiary dividends paid to the parent company and parent company capital contributions. in the event of a rapid change in market risk conditions causing smr to decline, the company has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 100 billion as a capital contingency plan. additionally, subject to market conditions, the company expects that it could take action to enter into derivatives on unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investments with foreign currency options or forwards or execute additional internal reinsurance transactions with aflac re. see notes 8 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.the company has already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of aflac japans smr. for example, the company employs policy reserve matching (prm) investment strategies, which is a japan specific accounting treatment that reduces smr interest rate sensitivity since prm designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. in order for a prm designated asset to be held at amortized cost, there are certain criteria that must be maintained. the primary criterion relates to maintaining the duration of designated assets and liabilities within a specified tolerance range. if the duration difference is not maintained within the specified range without rebalancing, then a certain portion of the assets must be reclassified as available for sale and held at fair value with any associated unrealized gain or loss recorded in surplus. to rebalance, assets may need to be sold in order to maintain the duration with the specified range, resulting in realizing a gain or loss from the sale. for u.s. gaap, prm investments are categorized as available for sale. the company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge a portion of its u.s. dollar denominated investments. see notes 3, 4 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the companys investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively. aflac japans smr remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. as of december 31, 2023, aflac japans smr was 1,219%, compared with 878% at december 31, 2022. the company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels, consistent with maintaining current insurance financial strength and credit ratings. the fsa is considering the introduction of an economic value based solvency regime based on the insurance capital standards (ics) for insurance companies in japan. the fsa continues to conduct field testing with insurance companies in japan for the purpose of investigating the impact of the introduction of such regulations. final specifications are expected to be decided in 2024, and a new capital regime to replace the current solvency regime is expected to be introduced in aflac japans 2025 fiscal year.aflac u.s.a life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the naic, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. statutory accounting rules are different from u.s. gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. the continued long term growth of the companys business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of its insurance operations. the companys insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings, reduced dividends paid to the parent company, capital contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings, or reinsurance transactions. the naics rbc formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. the rbc formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations.the combined rbc ratio for aflac u.s. as of december 31, 2023 was 710%, compared with 732% as of december 31, 2022. the company calculates its combined rbc ratio to include all u.s. regulated life insurance entities as if a single combined u.s. rbc entity net of intercompany items related to capital resources and risk. the company intends to maintain a target combined rbc over time of approximately 400% for aflac u.s., consistent with the companys risk management practices.69item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

solvency regulation framework. the smi focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. the naic still has some ongoing initiatives related to smi, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements as well as rbc. the naic utilizes a group capital calculation (gcc) that conceptually uses an rbc aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance company holding system. the gcc is intended to be a regulatory tool used by regulators as a means to standardize group capital requirements.aflac, caic and toic are domiciled in nebraska and are subject to its regulations. the ndoi imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances to the parent company. under nebraska insurance law, prior approval of the ndoi is required for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. dividends declared by aflac during 2024 in excess of $1.1 billion would be considered extraordinary and require such approval. similar laws apply in new york, the domiciliary jurisdiction of aflac new york.corporate and otheraflac re is licensed by the bma as a long term insurer and is subject to the bermuda insurance act of 1978 (bermuda insurance act). aflac re is required to file an annual return for its bermuda solvency capital requirement (bscr) which utilizes an economic balance sheet (ebs) framework to determine aflac res enhanced capital requirement (ecr). aflac re is also subject to a minimum margin of solvency (mms) related to its statutory financial statements. the mms is equal to the greater of $500,000, 1.5% of the total statutory assets, or 25% of ecr.under the ebs framework, aflac re is required to value assets equal to u.s. gaap fair values, and insurance reserves are valued using technical provisions which consist of a best estimate liability plus a risk margin. the best estimate liability can be calculated by applying the standard approach or, with regulatory approval, the scenario based approach. the standard approach uses discount rates for insurance reserves as prescribed by the bma. the scenario based approach uses a discount rate based on the yield of eligible assets owned by the insurer as determined using a series of prescribed stress scenarios. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, aflac re was in compliance with the ecr and mms requirements.under the bermuda insurance act, aflac re is prohibited from paying dividends in an amount that exceeds 25% of the prior years statutory capital and surplus without an affidavit stating that aflac re will continue to meet its solvency margin. further, aflac re may not reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more without prior regulatory approval. additionally, aflac re is not permitted to pay any dividends that would cause aflac re to fail to meet its minimum capital requirements.otherfor information regarding commitments and contingent liabilities, see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.additional informationinvestors should note that

preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the company to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. the estimates that the company deems to be most critical to an understanding of its results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, dac, liabilities for future policy benefits, and income taxes. the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. calculations of dac and the lfpb require the use of estimates based on actuarial valuation techniques. the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 93% of the companys assets and 80% of its liabilities are reported as of december 31, 2023, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.on january 1, 2023, the company adopted accounting standards update (asu) 2018 12, financial services insurance: targeted improvements to the accounting for long duration contracts (ldti). the update significantly changes how insurers account for long duration contracts and amends existing recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements applicable to the company related to liabilities for future policy benefits and dac. as part of this adoption, the company measures together all payments under an insurance contract including future expected claims and unpaid policy claims and related expenses, as an integrated reserve. this resulted in unpaid policy claims on long duration insurance contracts and accrued claim adjustment expenses that were presented separately in the companys consolidated balance sheets pre adoption to now be presented as part of liabilities for future policy benefits.valuation of investments, including derivativesthe companys investments, primarily consisting of debt and equity securities, include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. for publicly issued securities, the company determines the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. for the majority of privately issued securities and derivatives associated with vies within the companys investment portfolio, a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models that the company utilizes to determine fair values. these models and associated processes and controls are executed by company personnel. for the remaining privately issued securities, the company uses non binding price quotes from outside brokers. the companys valuation model for private placements explicitly incorporates currency basis swap adjustments (market observable data) to assumed interest rate curves where appropriate.the company estimates the fair values of its securities on a monthly basis. the company monitors the estimated fair values obtained from its pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. the company also periodically discusses with its pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. if a fair value appears unreasonable, the company will re examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. additionally, the company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. based on managements analysis, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. the company has performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value. inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility.the company estimates an expected lifetime credit loss on investments measured at amortized cost including held to maturity fixed maturity securities, loan receivables and loan commitments on a quarterly basis. for the companys available for sale fixed maturity securities, the company evaluates estimated credit losses only when the fair value of the available for sale fixed maturity security is below its amortized cost basisthe companys approach to estimating credit losses is complex and incorporates significant judgments. in addition to a security, or an asset class, or an issuer specific credit fundamentals, it considers past events, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. the companys estimates are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.71item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see the tabular disclosure entitled "sensitivity of fair values of financial instruments to interest rate change" in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.deferred policy acquisition costs and liability for future policy benefitssubstantially all of the supplemental health and life insurance policies the company issues are classified as long duration contracts. the contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, the company may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the u.s. within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.insurance premiums for most of the companys health and life policies, including cancer, accident, hospital, critical illness, supplemental dental and vision, term life, whole life, long term care and disability, are recognized as earned premiums over the premium paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. when earned premiums are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues. this association is accomplished by means of annual increases or decreases to the lfpb and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.premiums from the companys products with limited pay features, including cancer, medical and nursing care, term life, whole life, ways, and child endowment, are collected over a significantly shorter period than the contract term (i.e., the period during which benefits are provided). premiums for these products are recognized as earned premiums over the premium paying periods when due from policyholders. any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded as a deferred profit liability, a component of the lfpb, which is subsequently amortized in net earned premiums such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force. benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. an lfpb is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.deferred policy acquisition costsamortization of dac is computed using the same contract groupings (also referred to as cohorts) and mortality and termination assumptions that are used in computing the lfpb and these assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually. the effects of changes in assumptions are recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term as a revision of the future amortization pattern, while current period amortization is calculated based on the actual experience during the quarter. for additional information, see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.liability for future policy benefitsthe companys lfpb is determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under u.s. gaap and actuarial standards of practice and represent claims that are expected to occur in the future and already incurred claims (which represent claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to the company) and are measured using the net level premium method. future policy benefits are calculated using assumptions and estimates including mortality, morbidity, termination (also referred to as lapses), expense, and discount rates. the assumptions and estimates that the company uses depend on its judgment regarding the likelihood of future events and are inherently uncertain. cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and termination) are established at policy inception and are evaluated each quarter to determine if an update is needed. to facilitate a more detailed review of cash flow assumptions, experience studies are performed annually during the third quarter. changes in cash flow assumptions are recognized in reserve remeasurement (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of earnings. expense assumptions are established at policy inception and are not updated. actual experience is reflected in the calculation of future policy benefits each quarter, and changes in the liability due to actual experience are recognized in reserve remeasurement (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of earnings.discount rates used to calculate net premiums are locked in at policy inception and represent the basis to recognize interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. discount rates used to measure the carrying value of lfpb in the consolidated balance sheets are updated each reporting period, and the differences between the liability balances calculated using the locked in discount rates and the updated discount rates are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci). the discount rate methodology is designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets where the respective policies were issued in the currency in which the policies are denominated. for the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the single a debt market is not liquid or there is little or no observable market data, the company uses various estimation techniques consistent with the fair value 72item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations guidance in asc 820 fair value measurement, which include, but are not limited to: (i) for tenors where there is less observable market data and or the observable market data is available for similar instruments, estimating tenor specific single a credit spreads and applying them to risk free government rates (ii) for tenors where there is very limited or no observable single a or similar market data, interpolation and extrapolation techniques.if interest rates decreased by 100 basis points, the companys lfpb balance as of december 31, 2023 would increase by $12.7 billion, and if interest rates increased by 100 basis points the companys lfpb balance as of december 31, 2023 would decrease by $9.9 billion.for additional information on future policy benefits, see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.income taxesincome tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing the companys income tax returns. deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the company expects the temporary differences to reverse. the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with u.s. gaap is a two step process. under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. the determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the companys management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event the company determines it is not more likely than not that it will be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the companys tax planning strategies and in particular the companys ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. the companys judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. aflac japan holds certain u.s. dollar denominated assets in a dst. these assets are mostly comprised of various u.s. dollar denominated commercial mortgage loans. the functional currency of the dst for u.s. tax purposes was historically the japanese yen. in 2022, the company requested a change in tax accounting method through the internal revenue services automatic consent procedures to change the functional currency of the dst for u.s. tax purposes to the u.s. dollar. as a result, foreign currency translation gains or losses on assets held in the dst are no longer recognized for u.s. tax purposes. the company historically recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign currency translation gains on the dst assets, which was released in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of the functional currency change. the release of the deferred tax liability resulted in the company recognizing an income tax benefit of $174 million in 2023 and $452 million in 2022.an increase or decrease in the companys effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the companys 2023 income tax expense of $43 million.for additional information on income taxes, see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in this report. new accounting pronouncementson january 1, 2023, the company adopted ldti employing a modified retrospective transition method, which required the amended guidance be applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented beginning on the january 1, 2021 transition date (transition date). the transition date impact from adoption resulted in a decrease in aoci of approximately $18.6 billion and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion. 73item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on the companys financial position or results of operations, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company is exposed primarily to the following types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and equity risk. fluctuations in these factors could impact the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. the company regularly monitors its market risks and uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to these market risks.currency riskaflac japan the functional currency of aflac japans insurance operations is the japanese yen. aflac japans premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen. aflac japan purchases yen denominated assets and u.s. dollar denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen denominated policy liabilities. these and other yen denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. most of aflac japans cash and liabilities are yen denominated. the company engages in hedging activities to mitigate certain currency risks from holding u.s. dollar denominated investments in aflac japan; however, this hedging program also has some inherent risks. there is a risk that in a scenario of long term yen weakening there could be significant derivative losses that create corresponding liquidity requirements to support interim derivative settlements. further, the derivatives used for hedging are shorter in duration than the hedged investments, so there is rollover risk. in unfavorable market environments, the rollover of derivatives throughout the hedging period could result in increased hedge costs. additionally, as discussed in detail in the risk factors section titled lack of availability of acceptable yen denominated investments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity, there is a risk that losses realized on derivative settlements during periods of yen weakening may not be recouped through realization of the corresponding holding currency gains on the hedged u.s. dollar denominated investments if these investments are not ultimately sold and converted to yen. the company has taken steps to refine the strategy to mitigate currency exposure of aflac japan from u.s. dollar denominated investments while balancing the consideration of the economic equity surplus in aflac japan. this refinement in strategy resulted in an increased amount of the unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investments held in aflac japan while at the same time mitigating hedge cost increases. generally, aflac japans exposure to the currency risk increases when its portfolio of unhedged u.s. dollar denominated investments increases. as the value of the u.s. dollar denominated investment portfolio in aflac japan fluctuates and the companys business model evolves, the company periodically reevaluates this size of the unhedged portfolio and may accordingly adjust up or down its currency hedging targets. see part i, item 1a. risk factors for the risk factor titled "the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate" for additional information. the parent companythe company is exposed to currency risk as an economic event when yen funds are actually converted into u.s. dollars. this occurs when yen denominated funds are paid as dividends and management fees from aflac japan to the parent company and with quarterly settlements of internal reinsurance transactions. the exchange rates prevailing at the time of yen payments will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. the company may use a portion of the yen dividend and management fee payments to service aflac incorporateds yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into u.s. dollars. in addition to yen payments and internal reinsurance, certain investment activities for aflac japan expose the company to economic currency risk when yen are converted into u.s. dollars. as noted above, the company invests a portion of its yen cash flows in u.s. dollar denominated assets. this requires that the company convert the yen cash flows to u.s. dollars before investing. as previously discussed, for certain of its u.s. dollar denominated securities, the company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of hedged investments. additionally, the parent company enters into forward contracts to accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency rate risk to dividend payments by aflac japan, and reducing enterprise wide hedge costs. the company also balances the volume of hedging instruments between forwards and options in an attempt to manage and balance the risks associated with collateral, hedge costs and cash settlements. if the markets experience a significant strengthening of yen, this could cause cash strain at the parent company as a result of cash collateral and potentially cash settlement 74item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskrequirements. based on the timing and severity of exchange rate fluctuations combined with the level of outstanding activity in this program, the cash strain at the parent company could be significant. aside from the activities discussed above, the company generally does not convert yen into u.s. dollars; however, it does translate financial statement amounts from yen into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. the company reports unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in aoci. in periods when the yen weakens against the dollar, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into u.s. dollars causes more u.s. dollars to be reported. the weakening of the yen relative to the u.s. dollar will generally adversely affect the value of the companys yen denominated investments in u.s. dollar terms. the company also considers the economic equity surplus in aflac japan and related exposure to foreign currency. the company manages this currency risk by investing a portion of aflac japans investment portfolio in u.s. dollar denominated securities and by the parent companys issuance of yen denominated debt. as a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on the companys net assets is reduced.the following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of the companys yen denominated assets and liabilities, and its consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of december 31.dollar value of yen denominated assets and liabilitiesat selected exchange rates(in millions)20232022yen/dollar exchange rates126.83

of accounting guidance on january 1, 2023 related to accounting for long duration insurance contracts.the company is required to consolidate certain vies. some of the consolidated vies in aflac japans portfolio use foreign currency swaps to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of aflac japan, in order to 75item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskminimize cash flow fluctuations. foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. there may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. prior to consolidation, the companys beneficial interest in these vies was a yen denominated available for sale fixed maturity security. upon consolidation, the original yen denominated investment was derecognized and the underlying fixed maturity securities and cross currency swaps were recognized. the combination of a u.s. dollar denominated investment and cross currency swap economically creates a yen denominated investment and has no impact on the companys net investment hedge position. similarly, the combination of the u.s. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards and options that the company has entered into, as discussed in the aflac japan investment subsection of md&a, economically creates a yen denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of the companys investment in aflac japan for net investment hedge purposes. for additional information regarding the companys aflac japan net investment hedge, see the hedging activities subsection of item 7. md&a. interest rate riskthe companys primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of its investments in debt securities. significant increases in interest rates cause declines in the values of the companys investment portfolio which also has a secondary impact on the companys overall evaluation of its deferred tax asset position. the company monitors its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis utilizing a full valuation methodology, measuring price volatility, and sensitivity of the fair values of its investments to interest rate changes on the debt securities the company owns. for example, if the current duration of a debt security is 10 years, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. likewise, the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. the estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt securities the company owns; derivatives and notes payable as of december 31

generally have a negative impact on the fair value of the companys debt 76item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksecurities. however, the company does not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses. for additional information on unrealized losses on debt securities, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.the company attempts

newly issued products in both the u.s. and japan and will re evaluate those assumptions as necessary. currently, when investments the company owns mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. overall, adequate profit margins exist in aflac japans aggregate block of business because of changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses.periodically, the company may enter into derivative transactions to hedge interest

261 .3 total fixed maturity securities$88,513 100.0 %$94,531 100.0 %the primary factor considered when determining the domicile of investment exposure is the legal country risk location of the issuer. however, other factors such as the location of the parent guarantor, the location of the companys headquarters or major business operations (including location of major assets), location of primary market (including location of revenue generation) and specific country risk publicly recognized by rating agencies can influence the assignment of the country (or geographic) risk location. when the issuer is a special financing vehicle or a branch or subsidiary of a global company, then the company considers any guarantees and or legal, regulatory and corporate relationships of the issuer relative to its ultimate parent in determining the proper assignment of country risk.79item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskderivative counterpartiesthe company is a direct counterparty to the majority of derivative instruments and is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. for the foreign currency swaps associated with the companys vie investments for which it is the primary beneficiary, the company bears the risk of foreign exchange and or credit loss due to counterparty default even though it is not a direct counterparty to those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for the companys vie and senior note and subordinated debenture swaps, foreign currency swaps, certain foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and interest rate swaptions is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet. if collateral posting agreements are not in place or the counterparty defaults on its collateral posting obligations, the counterparty risk associated with foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is the risk that at expiry of the contract, the counterparty is unable to deliver the agreed upon amount of yen at the agreed upon price or delivery date, thus exposing the company to additional unhedged exposure to u.s. dollars in the aflac japan investment portfolio. see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.equity riskmarket prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. the companys three largest equity exposures had a fair value of $320 million or approximately 29% of its total investment in equity securities as of december 31, 2023. if equity prices experienced a hypothetical broad based decline of 10%, the fair value of the companys equity investments would decline by approximately $109 million.80item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataitem 8. financial statements and supplementary datareport of independent registered public accounting firm82consolidated

reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ kpmg llpatlanta, georgiafebruary 22, 2024 82item 8. financial statements and supplementary datareport of independent registered public accounting firmto the shareholders

to the accounting for long duration contracts (ldti), effective january 1, 2023 with a transition date of january 1, 2021.basis for opinionthese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether

below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. fair value of certain privately issued securitiesas discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the company invests in certain privately issued securities that require judgment in the estimation of fair values. the fair values of privately issued securities are estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model, developed by a third party pricing vendor, and take into consideration unique characteristics of the securities and other market information to determine an issuer specific credit curve to estimate expected cash flows. judgment is required to determine the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation models, including the determination of the most appropriate comparable securities to develop an issuer 83item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataspecific credit curve when it cannot be developed from the specific security features. as of december 31, 2023, the values of certain privately issued securities are included within the financial statement captions of fixed maturity securities available for sale, at fair value of $69,578 million; fixed maturity securities available for sale consolidated variable interest entities, at fair value of $3,712 million; and, fixed maturity securities held to maturity, at amortized cost of $17,819 million. we identified the assessment of the fair values of certain privately issued securities as a critical audit matter. due to the complexity of the valuation models, subjective auditor judgment and specialized valuation skills and knowledge were needed to evaluate the valuation models, the methodology used to estimate fair value and the companys determination of the most appropriate comparable securities to develop an issuer specific credit curve, when necessary.the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls, with the assistance of valuation professionals, over the companys process to estimate the fair values of certain privately issued securities. this included controls over the companys determination of comparable securities, when appropriate, to develop an issuer specific credit curve to be used in the valuation models to estimate fair values. we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in assessing the estimated fair values of such securities, which includedevaluating the companys valuation methodology for compliance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles assessing the companys model developed by a third party to estimate the fair values of privately issued securities by determining that differences in fair values between that model and an internally developed model above pre established tolerances, if any, were investigated by the company evaluating, for a selection of privately issued securities, the comparable securities used to develop an issuer specific credit curve by assessing whether the determination of comparable securities was reasonable based on the companys methodology and our knowledge of the securities and the markets for such securitiesdeveloping an independent estimate of fair value for a selection of privately issued securities based on independently developed valuation models and assumptions, as applicable, using market data sources and comparing our independent estimate to the companys fair value.valuation of the liability for future policy benefitsas discussed in note 1 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the liability for future policy benefits (lfpb) is determined as the present value of expected future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of expected future net premiums receivable under the companys insurance contracts. future policy benefits are calculated using assumptions and estimates including mortality, morbidity, termination, and discount rates. cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and termination) are established at policy inception and are evaluated each quarter to determine if an update is needed. discount rates used to calculate net premiums are locked in at policy inception and represent the basis to recognize interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. discount rates used to measure the carrying value of the lfpb in the consolidated balance sheets are updated each reporting period, and the difference between the liability balances calculated using the locked in discount rates and the updated discount rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci). the companys lfpb was $83,718 million as of december 31, 2023.we identified the evaluation of certain assumptions used in estimating the lfpb as a critical audit matter. a high level of auditor effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective auditor judgment was involved in the evaluation of actuarial methodologies, certain cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and termination), and the discount rate curve assumptions for japan.the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. with the assistance of valuation and actuarial professionals, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the companys lfpb. this included controls related to actuarial methodologies and the development of certain cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and termination) and the discount rate curve. we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in assessing the methodology and assumptions used by the company to develop the discount rate curve for japan by developing an independent discount rate curve and comparing it to that used by the company. we also involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in84item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataassessing

supplementary dataaflac incorporated and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements1. summary of significant accounting policiesdescription of businessaflac incorporated (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in japan and the united states (u.s.). the companys insurance business is marketed and administered through aflac life insurance japan ltd. (alij) in japan and through american family life assurance company of columbus (aflac), american family life assurance company of new york (aflac new york), continental american insurance company (caic), tier one insurance company (toic) and aflac benefit solutions, inc. (abs) in the u.s. the companys operations consist of two reportable business segments: aflac japan, which includes alij, and aflac u.s., which includes aflac, aflac new york, caic, toic and abs. aflac new york is a wholly owned subsidiary of aflac. most of aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. with the exception of dental and vision products administered by abs, and certain group life insurance products, aflac u.s. markets and administers group products through caic, branded as aflac group insurance. additionally, aflac u.s. markets its consumer markets products through toic. the companys insurance operations in the u.s. and japan service the two markets for the companys insurance business. the parent company, other operating business units that are not individually reportable, and business activities, including reinsurance activities, not included in aflac japan or aflac u.s. are included in corporate and other.in 2022, the company established aflac re bermuda ltd. (aflac re), a bermuda domiciled insurer that reinsures certain policies issued by alij. aflac re is subject to regulation in bermuda, where the bermuda monetary authority (bma) has broad administrative powers relating to granting and revoking licenses to transact reinsurance business, approval of specific reinsurance transactions, capital requirements and solvency standards, limitations on dividends to shareholders, the nature of and limitations on investments, and the filing of financial statements in accordance with prescribed or permitted accounting practices. financial results from aflac re are included in corporate and other.basis of presentationthe company prepares its financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). these principles are established primarily by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). in these notes to the consolidated financial statements, references to u.s. gaap issued by the fasb are derived from the fasb accounting standards codificationtm (asc). the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the company to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. the most significant items on the companys balance sheet that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates and actuarial determinations subject to changes in the future are the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (dac), liabilities for future policy benefits and income taxes. these accounting estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, commission and other acquisition expenses and terminations by policyholders. as additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in the consolidated financial statements. although some variability is inherent in these estimates, the company believes the amounts provided are reasonable and reflective of the best estimates of management.the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, its subsidiaries, and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.significant accounting policiesforeign currency translation:the functional currency of aflac japan is the japanese yen. the company translates its yen denominated financial statement accounts into u.s. dollars as follows. assets and liabilities are translated at end of period exchange rates. realized gains and losses on security transactions are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. other revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated using average exchange rates for the period. the resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. the company includes in earnings the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions. 92item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe parent company has designated a majority of its yen denominated liabilities (notes payable and yen denominated loans) as non derivative hedges and foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of the companys net investment in aflac japan. outstanding principal and related accrued interest on these parent company liabilities and the fair value of these derivatives are translated into u.s. dollars at end of period exchange rates. currency translation adjustments and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses) in other comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.insurance revenue and expense recognition:substantially all of the supplemental health and life insurance policies the company issues are classified as long duration contracts. the contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, the company may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the u.s. within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.insurance premiums for most of the companys health and life policies, including cancer, accident, hospital, critical illness, supplemental dental and vision, term life, whole life, long term care and disability, are recognized as earned premiums over the premium paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. when earned premiums are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues. this association is accomplished by means of annual increases or decreases to the liability for future policy benefits (lfpb) and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.premiums from the companys products with limited pay features, including cancer, medical and nursing care, term life, whole life, ways, and child endowment, are collected over a significantly shorter period than the contract term (i.e., the period during which benefits are provided). premiums for these products are recognized as earned premiums over the premium paying periods when due from policyholders. any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded as a deferred profit liability, which is subsequently amortized in net earned premiums such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force. net premium is calculated as gross premium multiplied by the net premium ratio (npr) and represents the portion of gross premium required to provide for benefits and expenses. benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. an lfpb is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.policyholders also have an option to pay discounted advanced premiums for certain of the companys products. advanced premiums are deferred and recognized when due from policyholders over the otherwise required contractual premium payment period.benefit expense is bifurcated between benefits and claims and reserve remeasurement (gains) losses. the npr is used to measure benefit expense and is calculated as the ratio of the present value of actual and future expected benefits and expenses to the present value of actual and future expected gross premiums. a revised npr is calculated as of the beginning of each reporting period using updated future cash flow expectations. reserve remeasurement (gains) losses represent the difference between two reserve measures both calculated as of the beginning of the current reporting period using the same locked in discount rates. one reserve measure uses the npr as of the end of the prior reporting period, and the second uses the revised npr. benefits and claims represent the difference in the liability balance calculated as of the beginning of the current reporting period and the end of the current reporting period both using the revised npr and the locked in discount rates. the locked in interest accretion rate utilized for accretion of interest expense on insurance reserves is the original discount rate used at contract issue date.advertising expense is reported as incurred in insurance and other expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.cash and cash equivalents:cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased.investments:the companys debt securities consist of fixed maturity securities, which are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. securities classified as held to maturity are securities that the company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption and are carried at amortized cost. all other fixed maturity debt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. if the fair value is higher than the amortized cost for debt securities, the excess is an unrealized gain, and if lower than cost, the difference is an unrealized loss. the net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, less related deferred income taxes, are recorded through other comprehensive income and included in accumulated other comprehensive income.93item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataamortized cost of debt securities is based on the companys purchase price adjusted for accrual of discount, or amortization of premium, and recognition of impairment charges, if any. the amortized cost of debt securities the company purchases at a discount or premium will equal the face or par value at maturity or the call date, if applicable. interest is reported as income when earned and is adjusted for amortization of any premium or discount.the company has investments in marketable equity securities which are carried at fair value. changes in the fair value of equity securities are recorded in earnings as a component of net investment gains (losses). the company has investments in variable interest entities (vies). criteria for evaluating vies for consolidation focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. the company is the primary beneficiary of certain vies, and therefore consolidates these entities in its financial statements. while the consolidated vies generally operate within a defined set of contractual terms, there are certain powers that are retained by the company that are considered significant in the conclusion that the company is the primary beneficiary. these powers vary by structure but generally include the initial selection of the underlying collateral; the ability to obtain the underlying collateral in the event of default; and, the ability to appoint or dismiss key parties in the structure. in particular, the companys powers surrounding the underlying collateral were considered to be the most significant powers because these most significantly impact the economics of the vie. the company has no obligation to provide any continuing financial support to any of the entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. the companys maximum loss is limited to its original investment. neither the company nor any of its creditors have the ability to obtain the underlying collateral, nor does the company have control over the instruments held in the vies, unless there is an event of default. for those entities where the company is the primary beneficiary, the consolidated entitys assets are segregated on the balance sheet by the caption "consolidated variable interest entities," and consist of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loan receivables, limited partnerships and derivative instruments. for the mortgage and asset backed securities held in the companys fixed maturity portfolio, the company recognizes income using a constant effective yield, which is based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. when estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. the net investment in mortgage and asset backed securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied at the time of acquisition. this adjustment is reflected in net investment income. the company uses the specific identification method to determine the gain or loss from securities transactions and report the realized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings as net investment gain or loss. securities transactions are accounted for based on values as of the trade date of the transaction.the company lends fixed maturity and public equity securities to financial institutions in short term security lending transactions. these securities continue to be carried as investment assets on the companys balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. the company receives cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. for loans involving unrestricted cash or securities as collateral, the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. for loans where the company receives as collateral securities that the company is not permitted to sell or repledge, the collateral is not reported as an asset.commercial mortgage and other loans include transitional real estate loans (tres), commercial mortgage loans (cmls), middle market loans (mmls), and other loans. the companys investments in tres, cmls, mmls, and other loans are accounted for as loan receivables and are recorded at amortized cost on the acquisition date. the company has the intent and ability to hold these loan receivables for the foreseeable future or until they mature and therefore, they are considered held for investment and are carried at amortized cost in the commercial mortgage and other loans line in its consolidated balance sheets. the amortized cost of the loan receivables reflects allowances for expected lifetime credit losses estimated as of each reporting date. income on commercial mortgage and other loans is recognized using the interest method. other investments include policy loans, limited partnerships, real estate owned (reo), and short term investments with maturities at the time of purchase of one year or less, but greater than 90 days. limited partnerships are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. under the equity method of accounting, the company reports its proportionate share of the investees earnings or losses as a component of net investment income in its consolidated statements of earnings. the underlying investments held by the companys limited partnerships primarily consist of private equity and real estate. reo consists of property held and used for the production of income and property held for sale. reo is obtained through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of certain of the companys loan receivables. when held for the 94item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataproduction of income, reo is recorded at fair value upon acquisition, which establishes the propertys initial cost basis. thereafter, it is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and written down to fair value for impairment losses. depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset and is reported in net investment income. a review for impairment is performed whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized in net investment gains (losses) when the carrying value of the property exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the property, at which point the carrying value is written down to an estimated fair value. real estate held for sale is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell and is subsequently measured at the lower of its initial carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. properties held for sale are not depreciated. net operating income earned on reo is reported as a component of net investment income. short term investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.the company designates nonaccrual status for a nonperforming loan or debt security or a loan or debt security that is not generating its stated interest rate because of nonpayment of periodic interest or principal by the borrower. the company applies the cash basis method to record any payments received on nonaccrual assets. the company resumes the accrual of interest on fixed maturity securities and loans that are currently making contractual payments or for those that are not current where the borrower has paid timely (less than 30 days outstanding). credit losses: the company estimates expected lifetime credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost including short term receivables, premiums receivable, held to maturity fixed maturity securities, loan receivables, loan commitments and reinsurance recoverables. for available for sale fixed maturity securities, the company evaluates estimated credit losses only when the fair value of the available for sale fixed maturity security is below its amortized cost basis. credit loss changes are recorded as a component of net investment gains (losses) for the companys held to maturity and available for sale securities, loan receivables, including collateral dependent assets, loan commitments and reinsurance recoverables, whereas credit losses on premium receivables are recorded in net earned premiums in the consolidated statement of earnings. the companys off balance sheet credit exposure is primarily attributable to loan commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. the company considers the contractual period of exposure to credit risk, the likelihood that funding will occur, the risk of loss, and the current conditions and expectations of future economic conditions to develop the estimate of expected credit losses. the company records the estimate of expected credit losses for certain loan commitments within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.write offs and partial write offs are recorded as a reduction to the amortized cost of the loan or fixed maturity security balance and a corresponding reduction to the credit allowance.the company has elected not to measure an allowance on accrued interest income for all asset types, because the uncollectible accrued interest receivable is written off in a timely manner. the company writes off accrued interest when it is more than ninety days past due by reducing interest income, which is a component of net investment income, in the consolidated statement of earnings.the company records due premium receivable net of current expected credit losses in the receivables line item in the consolidated balance sheet, utilizing an aging methodology based on historical loss information, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. changes in the estimated credit losses related to premium receivable are recorded in net earned premiums in the consolidated statement of earnings.derivatives and hedging: freestanding derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets and other liabilities, with changes in value reported in earnings and or other comprehensive income. these freestanding derivatives include foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options, foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions. the company does not use derivatives for trading purposes.the company may purchase certain investments or enter into contracts that contain embedded derivatives. the company assesses whether an embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to its host contract. if the company determines that the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from that contract, held at fair value, and reported with the host instrument in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. if the company has elected the fair value option, the embedded derivative is not bifurcated, and the entire investment is held at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings.see note 5 for a discussion on how the company determines the fair value of its derivatives. accruals on derivatives are typically recorded in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 95item 8. financial statements and supplementary datato qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk attributable to the hedged item. at the inception of hedging relationships the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the respective hedging relationship, and the methodology that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationship at and subsequent to hedge inception. the company documents the designation of each hedge as either (i) a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or the hedge of a forecasted transaction ("cash flow hedge"); (ii) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, attributable to a particular risk ("fair value hedge"); or (iii) a hedge of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net investment hedge"). the documentation process includes linking derivatives and non derivative financial instruments that are designated in hedge relationships with specific assets or groups of assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. at the hedge inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis, the company also formally assesses whether the derivatives and non derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities have been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective in offsetting their designated risk. the assessment of hedge effectiveness determines the accounting treatment of changes in fair value.hedge effectiveness is assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods. qualitative methods may include the comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item, and quantitative methods may include regression, dollar offset, or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship.for derivative instruments that are designated in cash flow hedge relationships, the gain or loss on the portion of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of effectiveness is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. amounts reclassified are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of earnings in which gain or loss on the hedged item is recorded. the company includes all components of each derivatives gain or loss in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.for derivative instruments that are designated in fair value hedge relationships, the gain or loss on the hedged item and the portion of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of earnings in which gain or loss on the hedged item is recorded. when assessing the effectiveness of the companys fair value hedges, the company excludes the changes in fair value related to the difference between the spot and forward rates on its foreign currency forwards, the change in fair value of cross currency swaps not resulting from fluctuations in spot currency rates, and the time value component of foreign exchange options and interest rate swaptions. for interest rate swaptions and cross currency interest rate swaps designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the excluded component is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into earnings (net investment income) over its legal term. for derivative and or non derivative hedging instruments designated in net investment hedge relationships with the companys investment in aflac japan, the company makes its net investment hedge designation at the beginning of each quarter. when the hedging instrument is a foreign currency derivative, the company assesses hedge effectiveness using the spot rate method. according to that method, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument due to fluctuations in the spot exchange rate is recorded in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings only when the hedged net investment is sold, or when a liquidation of the respective net investment in the foreign entity is substantially completed. if and when a sale or liquidation occurs, the changes in fair value of the derivative deferred in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income will be released in the same income statement line item where the gain (loss) on the hedged net investment would be recorded upon sale. all other changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are considered the excluded component and are accounted for in net investment gains (losses). should these designated net investment hedge positions exceed the companys net investment in aflac japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion that exceeds its investment in aflac japan would be recognized in current earnings within net investment gains (losses).the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated cash flows or fair value of a hedged item; (2) the derivative is de designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.when hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash flow hedge or fair value hedge, the derivative is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in current period earnings. for discontinued cash flow hedges, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the cash flow of the hedged item. 96item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataif a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are generally reported within other gains (losses), which is a component of net investment gains (losses). the fluctuations in estimated fair value of derivatives that have not been designated for hedge accounting can result in volatility in net earnings.the company receives and pledges cash or other securities as collateral on open derivative positions. cash received as collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. cash pledged as collateral is recorded as a reduction to cash, and a corresponding receivable is recognized for the return of the cash collateral. the company generally can repledge or resell collateral obtained from counterparties, although the company does not typically exercise such rights. securities received as collateral are not recognized unless the company was to exercise its right to sell that collateral or exercise remedies on that collateral upon a counterparty default. securities that the company has pledged as collateral continue to be carried as investment assets on its balance sheet. the company does not offset amounts recognized for derivative instruments and amounts recognized for the right to reclaim or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement.for additional information on the companys derivative instruments, see note 4.deferred policy acquisition costs: certain direct and incremental costs of acquiring insurance contracts are deferred and amortized on a grouped contract basis over the expected term of the related contracts, using a constant level basis. for life and health products issued in japan, the constant level basis used is units in force, which is a proxy for face amount, and insurance in force, respectively. for life and health products issued in the u.s., the constant level basis used is face amount and number of policies in force, respectively. amortization is computed using the same contract groupings (also referred to as cohorts) and mortality and termination assumptions that are used in computing the lfpb, and these assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually. the effects of changes in assumptions are recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term as a revision of the future amortization pattern, while current period amortization is calculated based on the actual experience during the quarter. deferred costs include the excess of current year commissions over ultimate renewal year commissions and certain incremental direct policy issue, underwriting and sales expenses directly related to successful policy acquisition.for some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. these transactions are known as internal replacements. the company performs a two stage analysis of the internal replacements to determine if the modification is substantive to the base policy. the stages of evaluation are as follows: 1) determine if the modification is integrated with the base policy, and 2) if it is integrated, determine if the resulting contract is substantially changed.for internal replacement transactions where the resulting contract is substantially unchanged, unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the cohort, and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred.for an internal replacement transaction that results in a policy that is substantially changed, the policy is treated as lapsed for amortization purposes, and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with the companys accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs.riders can be considered internal replacements that are either integrated or non integrated resulting in either substantially changed or substantially unchanged treatment. riders are evaluated based on the specific facts and circumstances of the rider and are considered an expansion of the existing benefits with additional premium required. non integrated riders to existing contracts do not change the companys profit expectations for the related products and are treated as a new policy establishment for incremental coverage.goodwill: goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. the amount of goodwill recognized is also impacted by measurement differences resulting from certain assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value (e.g. income taxes, employee benefits). goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at a level of a reporting unit at least annually, in the same reporting period each year. goodwill is included in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheets and was $265 million at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. a significant majority of the goodwill balance is attributable to the following business combinations within the aflac u.s. segment, which represents the 97item 8. financial statements and supplementary datareporting unit for goodwill impairment testing: (i) caic acquisition in 2009, (ii) empoweredbenefits, llc acquisition in 2015, (iii) abs acquisition in 2019, and (iv) acquisition of zurichs business in 2020.policy liabilities:for long duration insurance contracts, the company calculates an integrated reserve that represents all payments under the contract including future expected claims and unpaid policy claims and related expenses. the lfpb is measured using the net level premium method.long duration insurance contracts issued by the company are grouped into annual calendar year cohorts based on the contract issue date, reportable segment, legal entity and product type. limited pay contracts are grouped into separate cohorts from other traditional products in the same manner and are further separated based on their premium payment structures.the lfpb is determined as the present value of expected future policy benefits to be paid to or on the behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of expected future net premiums receivable under the companys insurance contracts, where expected future net premiums receivable are future gross premiums receivable under the contract multiplied by the npr.future policy benefits are calculated using assumptions and estimates including mortality, morbidity, termination (also referred to as lapses), expense and discount rates. the assumptions and estimates that the company uses depend on its judgment regarding the likelihood of future events and are inherently uncertain.cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and termination) are established at policy inception and are evaluated each quarter to determine if an update is needed. to facilitate a more detailed review of cash flow assumptions, experience studies are performed annually during the third quarter. changes in cash flow assumptions are the result of applying the updated best estimate assumptions as of the beginning of the reporting period and are recognized in reserve remeasurement (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of earnings. expense assumptions are established at policy inception and determined for each issue year cohort as a percentage of paid claims. these expense assumptions are locked in and remain unchanged over the term of the insurance policy. actual experience is reflected in the calculation of future policy benefits each quarter, and changes in the liability due to actual experience are recognized in reserve remeasurement (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of earnings.discount rates used to calculate net premiums are locked in at policy inception and represent the basis to recognize interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. discount rates used to measure the carrying value of the lfpb in the consolidated balance sheets are updated each reporting period, and the difference between the liability balances calculated using the locked in discount rates and the updated discount rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci).the company has designed its discount rate methodology for the u.s. and japan insurance business. the methodology incorporates constructing a current discount rate curve separately for discounting cash flows used to calculate the u.s. and japan lfpbs, reflective of the characteristics of the insurance liabilities, such as currency and tenor. discount rates comprising each curve are determined by reference to upper medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument yields that reflect the duration characteristics of the corresponding insurance liabilities. the company uses for these yields single a rated fixed income instruments with credit ratings based on international rating standards. where only local ratings are available, the company selects the fixed income instruments with local ratings that are equivalent to a single a rating based on international rating standards. the methodology is designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets where the respective policies were issued in the currency in which the policies are denominated. for the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the single a debt market is not liquid or there is little or no observable market data, the company uses various estimation techniques consistent with the fair value guidance in asc 820 fair value measurement, which include, but are not limited to: (i) for tenors where there is less observable market data and or the observable market data is available for similar instruments, estimating tenor specific single a credit spreads and applying them to risk free government rates (ii) for tenors where there is very limited or no observable single a or similar market data, interpolation and extrapolation techniques.the locked in discount rate used for the computation of interest accretion on lfpbs is determined separately for each issue year cohort as a single discount rate, calculated as the weighted average of monthly upper medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument forward curves in the calendar year, determined using the methodology described above and weighted using issued annualized premiums for each issue month. the single discount rate for each issue year cohort is determined by solving for a rate that produces an equivalent net premium ratio to the forward curve and will remain unchanged after the calendar year of issue.98item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataunearned premiums consist primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain aflac japan limited pay insurance products. these advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as earned premiums over the contractual premium payment period.the other policyholders funds liability consists primarily of the fixed annuity line of business in aflac japan which has fixed benefits and premiums.for internal replacements that are determined to be substantially changed, policy liabilities related to the original policy that was replaced are immediately released, and policy liabilities are established for the new insurance contract. the policy reserves are evaluated based on the new policy features, and changes are recognized at the date of contract change/modification. for internal replacements that are substantially unchanged, no changes to the reserves are recognized. for modifications that are not integrated with the base policy, new coverage is recognized as a separately issued contract within the current cohort.reinsurance: the company enters into reinsurance agreements in the normal course of business. for each reinsurance agreement, the company determines if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. reinsurance premiums and benefits paid or provided are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. premiums, benefits and acquisition costs are reported net of insurance ceded. income taxes: income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing the companys income tax returns. deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the company expects the temporary differences to reverse. the company records deferred tax assets for tax positions taken based on its assessment of whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized.policyholder protection corporation and state guaranty association assessments: in japan, the government has required the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation. the company recognizes a charge for its estimated share of the industrys obligation once it is determinable. the company reviews the estimated liability for policyholder protection corporation contributions on an annual basis and reports any adjustments in aflac japans expenses.in the u.s., each state has a guaranty association that supports insolvent insurers operating in those states. the companys policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domiciles statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. see note 15 for further discussion of the guaranty fund assessments charged to the company.treasury stock: treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of shareholders equity at cost. the company uses the weighted average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued. the company includes any gains and losses in additional paid in capital when treasury stock is reissued.share based compensation: the company measures compensation cost related to its share based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date, and the company recognizes those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. the company has made an entity wide accounting policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest and the corresponding forfeitures.earnings per share: the company computes basic earnings per share (eps) by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of unrestricted shares outstanding for the period. diluted eps is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of share based awards.reclassifications: certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year reporting classifications. these reclassifications had no impact on net earnings or total shareholders equity.99item 8. financial statements and supplementary datanew accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncementsaccounting standards update (asu) 2023 02 investments equity method and joint ventures (topic 323): accounting for investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization methodin march 2023, the fasb issued amendments to permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit).the company early adopted this guidance on july 1, 2023. the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or disclosures.asu 2022 02, financial instruments credit losses (topic 326): troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosuresin march 2022, the fasb issued amendments that eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (tdrs) for creditors, required enhanced disclosures for creditors about loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and required public business entities to include current period gross write offs in the vintage disclosure tables. as a result of eliminating the tdr guidance for creditors, all loan modifications will follow the existing loan refinancing or restructuring guidance. the company adopted this guidance on january 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. asu 2018 12 financial services insurance: targeted improvements to the accounting for long duration contracts, as clarified and amended by:asu 2019 09 financial services insurance: effective date asu 2020 11 financial services insurance: effective date and early applicationin august 2018, the fasb issued amendments that significantly changed how insurers account for long duration contracts. the company adopted the standard on january 1, 2023 using a modified retrospective transition method which resulted in applying the amended guidance as of the beginning of the earliest period presented on the january 1, 2021 transition date (transition date). the modified retrospective transition method generally results in applying the guidance to contracts on the basis of existing carrying values as of the transition date. on the transition date, the company calculated the ratio of the present value of expected future policy benefits and expenses less existing carrying values to the present value of expected future gross premiums (transition date npr) using updated assumptions and the discount rate immediately before the transition date. the company capped the transition date npr at 100% for any cohorts with a transition date npr greater than 100%. the company calculated the lfpb using the transition date npr (capped at 100% if required) and two different discount rates: (i) the discount rate used immediately before the transition date, and (ii) the discount rate determined by reference to the transition date market level yields for upper medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instruments (as of december 31, 2020). for cohorts with their transition date npr capped at 100%, the company recorded as an adjustment (decrease) to opening retained earnings any difference between the lfpb calculated using the discount rate immediately before the transition date and the existing carrying value as of the transition date. for all cohorts on the transition date, the company recorded in aoci net of tax, the difference in the lfpb calculated using the two different discount rates (i.e., the discount rate used immediately before the transition date and the updated discount rate as of the transition date). upon adoption, the company adjusted opening equity for the transition date impacts to aoci and retained earnings and adjusted prior periods presented (years 2021 and 2022) following the updated standard. based upon the modified retrospective transition method, the transition date impact from adoption resulted in a decrease in aoci of approximately $18.6 billion and a decrease in retained earnings (re) of approximately $0.3 billion. all relevant prior year amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of asu 2018 12. see note 6 and note 7 for expanded disclosures for dac and future policy benefits, respectively, required as a result of the amended guidance.100item 8. financial statements and supplementary datatransition

companys lfpb as a result of adoption, split between the changes in the present value of expected future net premiums and the present value of expected future policy benefits as of the transition date and the lfpb rollforward for the year ended december 31, 2021. the locked in discount rates on the policies held at the transition date reflect the locked in rates in existence immediately before the transition date. see note 7 for additional information. under the modified retrospective transition method, the npr for future policy benefits existing as of the transition date considers the carryover basis of those liabilities, which equals the future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims balance as of december 31, 2020. if the revised transition date npr for a cohort is greater than 100%, the company capped the transition date npr at 100% and increased the lfpb with an offsetting decrease to opening retained earnings. 101item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe lfpb recorded in the consolidated balance sheets includes the deferred profit liability for limited payment contracts. this deferred profit liability is not included in the transition date and lfpb

segment and selected foreign currency translation itemsthe company consists of two reportable insurance business segments: aflac japan and aflac u.s., both of which sell supplemental health and life insurance. in addition, the parent company, other operating business units that are not individually reportable, business activities, including reinsurance activities, not included in aflac japan or aflac u.s. and intercompany eliminations are included in corporate and other. the company does not allocate corporate overhead expenses to business segments. consistent with u.s. gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting, the company evaluates and manages its business segments using a financial performance measure called pretax adjusted earnings. pretax adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. the adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside managements control. the company excludes income taxes related to operations to arrive at pretax adjusted earnings. adjusted revenues are u.s. gaap total revenues excluding net investment gains and losses, except for amortized hedge costs/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and net interest cash flows from derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains (losses) and included in adjusted earnings as a component of adjusted net investment income when analyzing operations. adjusted expenses are u.s. gaap total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the companys insurance operations and that do not reflect the companys underlying business performance. aflac japans adjusted revenues accounted for 60% of the companys total adjusted revenues in 2023, compared with 64% in 2022 and 68% in 2021. the percentage of the companys total assets attributable to aflac japan was 80% at both december 31, 2023 and 2022.106item 8. financial statements and supplementary

issuers fundamental credit quality. the company evaluates independently those factors that it believes could influence an issuers ability to make payments under the contractual terms of the companys instruments. this includes a thorough analysis of a variety of items including the issuers country of domicile (including political, legal, and financial considerations); the industry in which the issuer competes (with an analysis of industry structure, end market dynamics, and regulation); company specific issues (such as management, assets, earnings, cash generation, and capital needs); and contractual provisions of the instrument (such as financial covenants and position in the capital structure). the company further evaluates the investment considering broad business and portfolio

been primarily related to general market changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and or the levels of credit spreads rather than specific concerns with the issuers ability to pay interest and repay principal. for any available for sale securities with significant declines in fair value, the company performs detailed analyses to identify whether the drivers of the declines are due to general market drivers, such as the recent rise in interest rates, or due to credit related factors. identifying the drivers of the declines in fair value helps to align and allocate the companys resources to securities with real credit related concerns that could impact ultimate collection of principal and interest. for any significant declines in fair value determined to be non interest rate or market related, the company performs a more focused review of the related issuers specific credit profile.for corporate issuers, the company evaluates their assets, business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning, financial statements and other available financial data. for non corporate issuers, the company analyzes all sources of credit support, including issuer specific factors. the company utilizes information available in the public domain and, for certain private placement issuers, from consultations with the issuers directly. the company also considers ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (nrsros), as well as the specific characteristics of the security it owns including seniority in the issuers capital structure, covenant protections, or other relevant features. from these reviews, the company evaluates the issuers continued ability to service the companys investment through payment of interest and principal.116item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataassuming no credit related factors develop, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are expected to diminish as investments near maturity. based on its credit analysis, the company believes that the issuers of its available for sale investments in the sectors shown in the table above have the ability to service their obligations to the company. further, the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.however, from time to time the company identifies certain available for sale securities where the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected due to credit related factors and as a result, a credit allowance will be estimated. based on an evaluation of its securities currently in an unrealized loss position, the company has determined that those securities should not have a credit loss allowance as of december 31, 2023. refer to the allowance for credit losses section below for additional information.as of december 31, 2023, the company had an immaterial amount of fixed maturity securities on nonaccrual status.commercial mortgage and other loansthe company classifies its tres, cmls, mmls, and other loans as held for investment and includes them in the commercial mortgage and other loans line on the consolidated balance sheets. the company carries them on the balance

(with the largest concentrations in california (21%), texas (12%) and florida (11%)). mmls are issued only to companies domiciled within the u.s. and canada.117item 8. financial statements and supplementary datatransitional real estate loanstres are commercial mortgage loans that are typically relatively short term floating rate instruments secured by a first lien on the property. these loans provide funding for properties undergoing a change in their physical characteristics and or economic profile and do not typically require any principal repayment prior to the maturity date. as of december 31, 2023, the company had $488 million in outstanding commitments to fund tres. these commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed.commercial mortgage loanscmls are typically fixed rate loans on commercial real estate with partial repayment of principal over the life of the loan with the remaining outstanding principal being repaid upon maturity. this loan portfolio is generally considered higher quality investment grade loans.middle market loansmmls are typically first lien senior secured cash flow loans to small to mid size companies for working capital, refinancing, acquisition, and recapitalization. these loans are generally considered to be below investment grade. the carrying value for mmls included $24 million and $28 million for a short term credit facility that is reflected in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, as of december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.as of december 31, 2023, the company had commitments of approximately $820 million to fund future mmls. these commitments are contingent upon the availability of mmls that meet the companys underwriting criteria.other loansother loans are primarily infrastructure loans. infrastructure loans are typically senior secured, financing operating portfolios of contracted solar and wind assets generating cash flow for loan repayment. the infrastructure loan portfolio weighted average rating is investment grade.credit quality indicatorsfor tres, the companys key credit quality indicators include loan to value (ltv), which is calculated by dividing the current outstanding loan balance by the estimated property value at origination, and performance of the loan. given that tres involve properties undergoing a repositioning of their commercial profile, ltv provides the most insight into the credit risk of the loan. the company monitors the performance of the loans periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly. the monitoring process also focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are delinquent or for which foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is anticipated.for cmls, the companys key credit quality indicators include ltv and debt service coverage ratios (dscr). dscr is the most recently available net operating income of the underlying property compared to the required debt service of the loan. for mmls and held to maturity fixed maturity securities, the companys key credit quality indicator is credit ratings. the companys held to maturity portfolio is composed of investment grade securities that are senior unsecured instruments, while its mmls generally have below investment grade ratings but are typically senior secured instruments. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly.for other loans, the companys key credit quality indicator is credit ratings. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly.118item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe following tables present as of december 31, 2023 the amortized cost basis of tres, cmls, mmls, and other loans by

its allowance for credit losses for held to maturity securities, loan receivables, loan commitments and reinsurance recoverable by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual asset. for held to maturity securities, mmls, and mml commitments, the company groups assets by credit ratings, industry, and country.120item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe company groups cmls and tres and respective loan commitments by property type, property location and the propertys ltv and dscr. on a quarterly basis, cmls and tres within a portfolio segment that share similar risk characteristics are pooled for calculation of credit loss allowance. on an ongoing basis, tres and cmls with dissimilar risk characteristics (i.e., loans with significant declines in credit quality), such as collateral dependent mortgage loans (i.e., when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is probable), are evaluated individually for credit loss. for example, the credit loss allowance for a collateral dependent loan is established as the excess of amortized cost over the estimated fair value of the loans underlying collateral, less selling cost when foreclosure is probable. accordingly, the change in the estimated fair value of the collateral dependent loans, which are evaluated individually for credit loss, is recorded as a change in the credit loss allowance.the credit allowance for held to maturity fixed maturity securities and loan receivables is estimated using a probability of default (pd) / loss given default (lgd) method, discounted for the time value of money. for held to maturity fixed maturity securities, available for sale fixed maturity securities and loan receivables, the company includes the change in present value due to the passage of time in the change in the allowance for credit losses. the companys methodology for estimating credit losses utilizes the contractual maturity date of the financial asset, adjusted when necessary to reflect the expected timing of repayment (such as prepayment options, renewal options, call options, or extension options). the company applies reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables that impact the determination of pd/lgd over a two year period for held to maturity fixed maturity securities and mmls. the company reverts to historical loss information over one year, following the two year forecast period. for the cml and tre portfolio, the company applies reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables as well as national and local real estate market factors to estimate future credit losses where the market factors revert back to historical levels over time with the period being dependent on current market conditions, projected market conditions and difference in the current and historical market levels for each factor. the company continuously monitors the estimation methodology, due to changes in portfolio composition, changes in underwriting practices and significant events or conditions and makes adjustments as necessary.the companys held to maturity portfolio includes japan government and agency securities of $16.9 billion amortized cost as of december 31, 2023 that meet the requirements for zero credit loss expectation and therefore these asset classes have been excluded from the current expected credit loss measurement.an investment in an available for sale security may be impaired if the fair value falls below amortized cost. the company regularly reviews its available for sale portfolio for declines in fair value. the companys available for sale impairment model focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from its investments and whether the company has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not the company would be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. the determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon the companys periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. when determining the companys intention to sell a security prior to recovery of its fair value to amortized cost, the company evaluates facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, future cash flow needs, decisions to reposition its security portfolio, and risk profile of individual investment holdings. the company performs ongoing analyses of its liquidity needs, which includes cash flow testing of its policy liabilities, debt maturities, projected dividend payments, and other cash flow and liquidity needs.the companys methodology for estimating credit losses for available for sale securities utilizes the discounted cash flow model, based on past events, current market conditions and future economic conditions, as well as industry analysis and credit ratings of the securities. in addition, the company evaluates the specific issuers probability of default and expected recovery of its position in the event of default based on the underlying financial condition and assets of the borrower as well as seniority and or security of other debt holders in the issuer when developing managements best estimate of expected cash flows.the following table presents the roll forward of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment

and public equity securities to financial institutions in short term securities lending transactions. these short term securities lending arrangements increase investment income with minimal risk. the company receives cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. the companys securities lending policy requires that the fair value of the securities received as collateral be 102% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities and that unrestricted cash received as collateral be 100% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities. the securities loaned continue to be carried as investment assets on the companys balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. for loans involving unrestricted cash or securities as collateral, the collateral is

(including u.s. territories). the company retains ownership of all securities on deposit and receives the related investment income. for general information regarding the companys investment accounting policies, see note 1.4. derivative instrumentsthe companys freestanding derivative financial instruments have historically consisted of: foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk on u.s. dollar denominated investments in aflac japans portfolio, with options used on a standalone basis and or in a collar strategy;foreign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen and hedge the companys long term exposure to a weakening yen;cross currency interest rate swaps, also referred to as foreign currency swaps, associated with certain senior notes and subordinated debentures;foreign currency swaps that are associated with vie bond purchase commitments, and investments in special purpose entities, including vies where the company is the primary beneficiary;interest rate swaps used to economically hedge interest rate fluctuations in certain variable rate investments;interest rate swaptions used to hedge changes in the fair value associated with interest rate fluctuations for certain u.s. dollar denominated available for sale fixed maturity securities; andbond purchase commitments at the inception of investments in consolidated vies.125item 8. financial statements and supplementary datasome of the companys derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges; however, other derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or the company elects not to designate them as accounting hedges. derivative typesforeign currency forwards and options are executed for the aflac japan segment in order to hedge the currency risk on the carrying value of certain u.s. dollar denominated investments. the average maturity of these forwards and options can change depending on factors such as market conditions and types of investments being held. in situations where the maturity of the forwards and options is shorter than the underlying investment being hedged, the company may enter into new forwards and options near maturity of the existing derivative in order to continue hedging the underlying investment. in forward transactions, aflac japan agrees with another party to buy a fixed amount of yen and sell a corresponding amount of u.s. dollars at a specified future date. the company also uses one sided foreign currency put options to mitigate the settlement risk on u.s. dollar denominated assets related to extreme foreign currency rate changes. from time to time, aflac japan also executes foreign currency option transactions in a collar strategy, where aflac japan agrees with another party to simultaneously purchase put options and sell call options. in the purchased put transactions, aflac japan obtains the option to buy a fixed amount of yen and sell a corresponding amount of u.s. dollars at a specified future date. in the sold call transactions, aflac japan agrees to sell a fixed amount of yen and buy a corresponding amount of u.s. dollars at a specified future date. the combination of purchasing the put option and selling the call option results in no net premium being paid (i.e. a costless or zero cost collar).from time to time, the company may also enter into foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the currency risk associated with the net investment in aflac japan. in these forward transactions, the company agrees with another party to buy a fixed amount of u.s. dollars and sell a corresponding amount of yen at a specified price at a specified future date. in the option transactions, the company may use a combination of foreign currency options to protect expected future cash flows by simultaneously purchasing yen put options (options that protect against a weakening yen) and selling yen call options (options that limit participation in a strengthening yen). the combination of these two actions create a zero cost collar. additionally, the company enters into purchased options to hedge cash flows from the net investment in aflac japan.the company enters into foreign currency swaps pursuant to which it exchanges an initial principal amount in one currency for an initial principal amount of another currency, with an agreement to re exchange the principal amounts at a future date. there may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. foreign currency swaps are used primarily in the consolidated vies in the companys aflac japan portfolio to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of aflac japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. the company also uses foreign currency swaps to economically convert certain of its u.s. dollar denominated senior note and subordinated debenture principal and interest obligations into yen denominated obligations.in order to reduce investment income volatility from its variable rate investments, the company enters into receivefixed, payfloating interest rate swaps. these derivatives are cleared and settled through a central clearinghouse.swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar denominated available for sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption, the company pays a premium to obtain the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost, a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption (the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap) and sells a short receiver swaption (the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap). the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid (i.e. a costless or zero cost collar).bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price, the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.126item 8.

used to swap the u.s. dollar (usd) variable rate interest and principal payments to fixed rate japanese yen (jpy) interest and principal payments. the company has designated foreign currency swaps as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset (cash flow hedge). the remaining maximum length of time for which these cash flows are hedged is approximately three years. the derivatives in the companys consolidated vies that are not designated as accounting hedges are discussed in the non qualifying strategies section of this note.fair value hedgesthe company designates and accounts for certain foreign currency forwards, options, and interest rate swaptions as fair value hedges when they meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the company recognizes gains and losses on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the related hedged items in current earnings. foreign currency forwards and options hedge the foreign currency exposure of certain u.s. dollar denominated available for sale fixed maturity investments held in aflac japan. the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards related to the changes in the difference between the spot rate and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. the change in fair value of the foreign currency option related to the time value of the option is recognized in current earnings and is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.127item 8. financial statements and

company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes changes in the intrinsic value of the swaptions in current earnings within net investment income. the change in the time value of the swaptions is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into earnings (net investment income) over its legal term. the following table presents the gains and

companys investment in aflac japan is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. to mitigate this exposure, the parent companys yen denominated liabilities (see note 9) have been designated as non derivative hedges and certain foreign currency forwards and options have been designated as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of the companys net investment in aflac japan. the companys net investment hedge was effective during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.non qualifying strategiesfor the companys derivative instruments in consolidated vies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in their fair value are reported in current period earnings within net investment gains (losses). the amount of gain or loss recognized in earnings for the companys vies is attributable to the derivatives in those investment structures. while the change in value of the swaps is recorded in current period earnings, the change in value of the available for sale fixed maturity securities associated with these swaps is recorded in other comprehensive income.as of december 31, 2023, the parent company had $1.2 billion notional amount of cross currency interest rate swap agreements related to certain of its u.s. dollar denominated senior notes to effectively convert a portion of the interest on the notes from u.s. dollar to japanese yen. changes in the values of these swaps are recorded in current period earnings.the company uses foreign currency forwards and options to economically mitigate the currency risk of some of its u.s. dollar denominated loan receivables held within the aflac japan segment. these arrangements are not designated as accounting hedges, as the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan receivables impacts current period earnings, and substantially offsets gains and losses from foreign currency forwards within net investment gains (losses). the company also has certain foreign currency forwards on u.s. dollar denominated available for sale securities where hedge accounting is not being applied. the company uses interest rate swaps to economically convert the variable rate investment income to a fixed rate on certain variable rate investments.129item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataimpact of derivatives and hedging instrumentsthe following table summarizes the impact to

(1) interest expense/income on cash flow hedges is recorded in net investment income. for interest rate swaptions classified as fair value hedges, the change in the time value of the swaptions is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into net investment income over its legal term. if the swaption is early terminated but the hedge item is still outstanding, the amortization of disposal amount of the swaptions is recorded in net investment income over the remaining life of the hedged items.(2) gains and losses on cash flow hedges and the change in the fair value of interest rate swaptions related to the time value of the swaptions in fair value hedges are recorded as unrealized gains (losses). gains and losses on net investment hedges related to changes in foreign currency spot rates are recorded in the unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses) line in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).(3) impact of cash flow hedges reported as net investment gains (losses) includes $4 of losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared with $4 of losses during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (4) includes $1 of losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared with $1 and $2 of losses during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to fair value hedges excluded component. impact shown net of effect of hedged items (see fair value hedges section of this note 4 for further detail).130item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataas of december 31, 2023, $5 million of deferred losses on derivative instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months.credit risk assumed through derivatives for the foreign currency swaps associated with the companys vie investments for which it is the primary beneficiary, the company bears the risk of loss due to counterparty default even though it is not a direct counterparty to those contracts. the company is a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that it has entered into in connection with certain of its senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; and foreign currency options, and therefore the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for the companys foreign currency swaps, certain foreign currency forwards, and foreign currency options is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet. as of december 31, 2023, all of the companys derivative agreement counterparties were investment grade. the company engages in over the counter (otc) bilateral derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under international swaps and derivatives association, inc. (isda) agreements and other documentation. most of the isda agreements also include credit support annexes (csas) provisions, which generally provide for two way collateral postings at the first dollar of exposure. the company mitigates the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value while generally requiring that collateral be posted at the outset of the transaction. in addition, a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction upon a downgrade of the companys financial strength rating. the actual amount of payments that the company could be required to make depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions, and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.the company also engages in otc cleared derivative transactions through regulated central clearing counterparties. these positions are marked to market and margined on a daily basis (both initial margin and variation margin), and the company has minimal exposure to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these derivatives.collateral posted by the company to third parties for derivative transactions can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position by counterparty was approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. if the credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on december 31, 2023, the company estimates that it would be required to post a maximum of $363 million of additional collateral to these derivative counterparties. the company is generally allowed to sell or repledge collateral obtained from its derivative counterparties, although it does not typically exercise such rights. see the offsetting tables below for collateral posted or received as of the reported balance sheet dates.offsetting of financial instruments and derivativesmost of the companys derivative instruments are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide for the net settlement of all derivative contracts between the parent company or its subsidiaries and the respective counterparty in the event of default or upon the occurrence of certain termination events. collateral support agreements with the master netting arrangements generally provide that the company will receive or pledge financial collateral at the first dollar of exposure. the company has securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to the company in return for the use of its fixed maturity and public equity securities (see note 3). when the company has entered into securities lending agreements with the same counterparty, the agreements generally provide for net settlement in the event of default by the counterparty. this right of set off allows the company to keep and apply collateral received if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from the company as contractually agreed.the tables below summarize the companys derivatives and securities lending transactions as of december 31, and as reflected in the tables, in accordance with u.s. gaap, the companys policy is to not offset these financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets.131item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataoffsetting of financial assets and derivative assets2023gross amounts not offset in

valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. these two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets or model derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market. the following tables present the fair value hierarchy levels of the companys assets and

accounting guidance on january 1, 2023 related to accounting for long duration insurance contracts.fair value of financial instrumentsfixed maturity and equity securitiesthe fair values of the companys public fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices provided by third party pricing vendors. the company utilizes internally generated valuations or broker quotes for privately issued fixed maturity securities or fixed maturity securities where there is no price available from a third party pricing vendor.the fair values of the companys public equity securities are generally based on price quotes, including quoted market prices readily available from independent public exchange markets or established security dealer associations. the company determines the fair values of privately issued equity securities using the following approaches or techniques: price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors, in house valuations and non binding price quotes the company obtains from outside brokers.the pricing data and market quotes the company obtains from outside sources, including third party pricing services, are reviewed internally for reasonableness. if a fair value appears unreasonable, the company will re examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the provider. additionally, the company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. based on managements analysis, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. the company has performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models, including independent validations and back testing, to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value. for the periods presented, the company has not adjusted the quotes or prices it obtains from the pricing services and brokers it uses.for internally generated valuations, the company utilizes valuation models developed by a third party pricing vendor. the models and associated processes and controls are executed by company personnel. 139item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathese models are discounted cash flow (dcf) valuation models but also use information from related markets, specifically public bond markets and the credit default swap (cds) market, to estimate expected cash flows. the models take into consideration any unique characteristics of the securities and make various adjustments to arrive at an appropriate issuer specific loss adjusted credit curve using the most appropriate comparable security(ies) of the issuer and issuer specific cds spreads. this credit curve is then used with the relevant recovery rates to estimate expected cash flows and modeling of additional features, including illiquidity adjustments, if necessary, to price the security by discounting those loss adjusted cash flows. in cases where a credit curve cannot be developed from market information for the specific issuer, the valuation methodology takes into consideration other market observable inputs, including: 1)the most appropriate comparable security(ies) of a guarantor and or parent2)cds spreads of a guarantor and or parent3)bonds of comparable issuers with similar characteristics such as rating, geography, or sector4)cds spreads of an appropriate index or of comparable issuers with similar characteristics such as rating, geography, or sector5)bond indices that are comparative in rating, industry, maturity, and region.the following tables present the pricing sources for the fair values of the companys fixed maturity and equity securities as of december 31.140item 8. financial

uses derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets. however, the derivative instrument may not be classified in the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset. the significant inputs to pricing derivatives are generally observable in the market or can be derived by observable market data. when these inputs are observable, the derivatives are classified as level 2.the company uses present value techniques to value non option based derivatives. it also uses option pricing models to value option based derivatives. key inputs are as follows: instrument typelevel 2interest rate derivatives swap yield curvesbasis curvesinterest rate volatility (1)foreign currency exchange rate derivatives non vies (forwards, swaps and options)foreign currency forward ratesswap yield curvesbasis curvesforeign currency spot ratescross foreign currency basis curvesforeign currency volatility (1)foreign currency exchange rate derivatives vies (swaps)foreign currency spot ratesswap yield curvescredit default swap curvesbasis curvesrecovery ratesforeign currency forward ratesforeign cross currency basis curves(1) option based only 144item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe fair values of the foreign currency forwards and options are based on observable market inputs, therefore they are classified as level 2. the parent company has cross currency swap agreements related to certain of its u.s. dollar denominated senior notes to effectively convert a portion of the interest on the notes from u.s. dollar to japanese yen. their fair values are based on observable market inputs, therefore they are classified as level 2. to determine the fair value of its interest rate derivatives, the company uses inputs that are generally observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. interest rate swaps are cleared trades. in a cleared swap contract, the clearinghouse provides benefits to the counterparties similar to contracts listed for investment traded on an exchange since it maintains a daily margin to mitigate counterparties credit risk. these derivatives are priced using observable inputs, accordingly, they are classified as level 2. for derivatives associated with vies where the company is the primary beneficiary, the company is not the direct counterparty to the swap contracts. nevertheless, the company has full transparency into the contracts to properly value the swaps for reporting purposes. for these derivatives, the company utilizes valuation models developed by independent valuation analytics providers. the models are market standard dcf models and all associated processes and controls are executed by company personnel. these models take into consideration any unique characteristics of the derivatives in determining the appropriate valuation methodology to estimate expected cash flows. the fair values of these swaps are based on observable market inputs and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.for forward bond purchase commitments with vies, the fair value of the derivative is based on the difference in the fixed purchase price and the current market value of the related bond prior to the settlement date. since the bond is typically a public bond with readily available pricing, the derivatives associated with the forward purchase commitment are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.commercial mortgage and other loanscommercial mortgage and other loans include tres, cmls, mmls and other loans. the companys loan receivables do not have readily determinable market prices and generally lack market liquidity. fair values for loan receivables are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable u.s. treasury or floating rate benchmark yield plus an appropriate spread that considers other risk factors, such as credit and liquidity risk. the spreads are a significant component of the pricing inputs and are generally considered unobservable. therefore, these investments are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.other investmentsother investments includes short term investments that are measured at fair value where amortized cost approximates fair value.other policyholders fundsthe largest component of the other policyholders funds liability is the companys annuity line of business in aflac japan. the companys annuities have fixed benefits and premiums. for this product, the company estimates the fair value to be equal to the cash surrender value. this is analogous to the value paid to policyholders on the valuation date if they were to surrender their policy. the company periodically checks the cash value against discounted cash flow projections for reasonableness. the company considers its inputs for this valuation to be unobservable and have accordingly classified this valuation as level 3. notes payablethe fair values of the companys publicly issued notes payable are determined by utilizing available sources of observable inputs from third party pricing vendors and are classified as level 2. the fair values of the companys yen denominated loans approximate their carrying values and are classified as level 3. 145item 8. financial statements and supplementary datatransfers between hierarchy levels and level 3 rollforwardassets and liabilities are transferred into level 3 when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data. this occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed, current prices are not available, and or when there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby affecting transparency. assets and liabilities are transferred out of level 3 when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data. this may be due to a significant increase in market activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s) becoming observable.the following tables present the changes in fair value of the companys investments

financial statements and supplementary datathe following is a discussion of the significant unobservable inputs or valuation techniques used in determining the fair value of securities classified as level 3. credit spreadsthe company holds certain assets that are of a unique, specialized, and or securitized nature that do not trade on a regular basis in an active market, which makes their fair values difficult to estimate. most of these assets are managed by external asset managers and the company utilizes these managers for their expertise when evaluating various inputs used to determine the fair values for these assets, including identifying the appropriate credit or risk spread over risk free interest rates that incorporates the unique nature or structure of the asset in the valuations. for those assets of a similar nature but not managed by external asset managers, the company internally estimates the spreads and risk adjustments over risk free interest rates that reflect the unique nature or structure of the asset as well as the current pricing environment and market conditions for comparable or related investments. credit or risk spreads are an important input needed to complete the discounted cash flow analyses used to estimate an investments fair value. credit or risk spreads underlying these fair values are a significant, unobservable input whose derivation is based on the companys evaluation of a combination of the external managers expertise and knowledge, the current pricing environment, and market conditions for the specific asset.offered quotesin circumstances where the companys valuation model price is overridden because it implies a value that is not consistent with current market conditions, the company will solicit bids from a limited number of brokers. the company also receives unadjusted prices from brokers for certain of its mortgage and asset backed securities. these quotes are non binding but are reflective of valuation best estimates at that particular point in time. offered quotes are an unobservable input in the determination of fair value of mortgage and asset backed securities, certain banks/financial institutions, certain other corporate, and equity securities investments.private financialsthe company invests in the debt and equity securities of private companies operating in the cancer, healthtech, insurtech, finance, internet of things, big data and analytics sectors. due to their private and often small, startup nature, these companies rely on capital provided by institutional and private equity investors for their ongoing operations. they do not have public securities that trade on a regular basis in an active market, which makes their fair values difficult to estimate. the company values these investments on a cost basis with appropriate adjustments made based on monitoring private financial information provided by these companies. adjustments to valuations are generally made as new funding tranches are executed or if the financial information provided significantly changes indicating the need for impairment. this private financial information is unobservable and is a significant determinant in the fair value of these corporate venture investments.for additional information on the companys investments and financial instruments, see notes 1, 3

deferred as a percentage of total acquisition costs deferred were 67% in 2023, compared with 68% in 2022 and 71% in 2021.the company uses the following constant level bases to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs:policy typeconstant level basislife products (u.s.)face amounthealth products (u.s.)number of policies in forcehealth & life products (japan)units in force149item 8. financial statements and supplementary dataface amount is the stated dollar amount that the policys beneficiaries receive upon the death of the insured. for life and health products issued in japan, the constant level basis used is units in force, which is a proxy for face amount and insurance in force, respectively. future dac amortization is impacted by persistency.there were no changes to the inputs or methods used to determine amortization amounts during 2023 and 2022. the company updated the assumptions used to determine amortization using the same assumptions as those used for measuring the liability for future policy benefits during 2023 and 2022. the company recognizes the effects of changes in assumptions prospectively over the remaining contract term as a revision of the future amortization pattern. see note 1 for additional information on deferred policy acquisition costs.personnel, compensation and benefit expenses as a percentage of insurance expenses were 61% in 2023, compared with 60% in 2022 and 57% in 2021. advertising expense, which is included in insurance expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings, was as follows for the years ended december 31:(in

income instrument yields that reflect the duration characteristics of the liability. locked in discount rates are determined separately for each issue year cohort as a single discount rate, calculated as the weighted average of monthly upper medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument forward curves in the calendar year, where the weights are the annualized premiums issued for each month of the cohort. the single discount rate for each issue year cohort is determined by solving for a rate that produces an equivalent net premium ratio to the forward curve and will remain unchanged after the calendar year of issue.discount rates are updated each reporting period and require estimation techniques (e.g., interpolation, extrapolation) for determination of points on the curve for which there is limited or no observable market data. the company constructs a current discount rate curve separately for discounting cash flows used to calculate each of the japan and u.s. liabilities for future policy benefits, reflective of the characteristics of the corresponding insurance liabilities, such as currency and tenor.in the aflac japan segment, all long duration insurance policies are denominated in yen. a significant portion of policies are characterized by tenors exceeding the availability of liquid market data in japan for single a rated (as a proxy for upper medium grade) corporate yen denominated debt. the discount rate curve is designed to prioritize the observable inputs where available, while past the last liquid point, the data is derived based on estimation techniques consistent with the fair value guidance in asc 820. the aflac japan segment curve utilizes liquid market indices tracking publicly traded yen denominated single a corporate debt for the initial 10 year tenor. for the bonds within these market indices where only local ratings are available, the company prioritizes the bonds with local ratings that are equivalent to a single a rating based on international rating standards.for the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the japan single a debt market is not liquid but there is sufficient observable market data and or the observable market data is available for similar instruments (between 10 and 30 years), the company estimates tenor specific single a credit spreads and applies them to risk free government rates. lastly, for the tenors where there is limited or no observable single a or similar market data or risk free government rates (beyond 30 years), the discount curve is derived by extrapolation of risk free rates beyond their last liquid point following the smith 154item 8. financial statements and supplementary datawilson method and grading of the estimated forward credit spread anchored by the ultimate forward rate. the ultimate forward rate is based on the economic value based solvency regime, which is consistent with the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) insurance capital standards (ics) (which is expected to be introduced in japan in 2025), and is adjusted for credit and inflation components. for the aflac u.s. segment where all long duration insurance policies are denominated in u.s. dollar and substantially all have cash flow duration within 30 years, for which the u.s. upper medium grade fixed income market is liquid and observable, the company uses data from a liquid fixed income market index tracking single a u.s. corporate debt. for the insignificant portion of the policies with cash flow tenors exceeding 30 years, the discount curve beyond that tenor is extrapolated following the smith wilson method from year 30 to the same ultimate forward rate calculated for the japan discount curve at year 60 and held constant thereafter. the use of the same ultimate rate for u.s. and japan segments is based on the assumption of long term global economic convergence. for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company recognized approximately $(460) million, $13.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) net of tax due to changes in the future policy benefits estimate from updating the discount rate assumptions. there were no changes to the methods used to determine the discount rates during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.mortality rate assumptions are based on industry tables and adjusted for the companys actual or expected experience where credible or appropriate. these assumptions typically vary by age, gender, and other demographic characteristics such as smoking status.morbidity assumptions are based on the companys internal data and consider emerging experience. these assumptions are reflective of the coverage and benefits provided and generally vary by age, gender, duration, and any other material policyholder characteristics. in cases where a calendar year trend is significant, future cash flow projections may include a trend adjustment. in japan, separate lapse assumptions are set based on actual or expected experience. these lapse and total termination rate assumptions vary by line of business and with policyholder characteristics such as duration. in the u.s., the majority of the future cash flows are modeled using total termination rates (which include both lapse and mortality) and are adjusted for actual experience. policy provisions, such as reaching premium paid up status, are taken into account when setting assumptions.in 2023 and 2022, the variance of actual experience from expected experience was primarily due to favorable variances in morbidity assumptions as compared to actual experience. there were no changes to the inputs or methods used in measuring the liability for future policy benefits in 2023 and 2022.in 2023, the companys annual assumption review process resulted in favorable changes to its morbidity and termination assumptions, largely due to reflecting more recent favorable u.s. morbidity experience. in 2022, the companys annual assumption review process resulted in favorable changes to its morbidity assumptions due to favorable claims experience, primarily.155item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe following table summarizes the amount of net earned premiums recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings by reporting

amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of accounting guidance on january 1, 2023 related to accounting for long duration insurance contracts.the japan income tax rate for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 28.0%. aflac japan holds certain u.s. dollar denominated assets in a delaware statutory trust (dst). these assets are mostly comprised of various u.s. dollar denominated commercial mortgage loans. the functional currency of the dst for u.s. tax purposes was historically the japanese yen. in 2022, the company requested a change in tax accounting method through the internal revenue services automatic consent procedures to change the functional currency of the dst for u.s. tax purposes to the u.s. dollar. as a result, foreign currency translation gains or losses on assets held in the dst are no longer recognized for u.s. tax purposes. the company historically recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign currency translation gains on the dst assets, which was released in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of the functional currency change. the release of the deferred tax liability resulted in the company recognizing an income tax benefit of $174 million in 2023 and $452 million in 2022.in august 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) was signed into u.s. law, which among other things imposed a 1% excise tax on the companys repurchases of its common stock. effective january 1, 2023, charges associated with the excise tax are recognized in equity consistent with other costs related to treasury stock.income tax expense in the accompanying

related to accounting for long duration insurance contracts.the application of u.s. gaap requires the company to evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized. the company has determined no valuation allowance against its anticipatory foreign tax credits is necessary. the anticipatory foreign tax credit represents the foreign tax credit the company will generate from the reversal of japan 168item 8. financial statements and supplementary datadeferred tax liabilities in the future. deferred foreign tax credits are foreign tax credits generated in the current tax year by the japanese life company, but are unable to be utilized until 2024 due to japans current tax year not closing until march 31, 2024. based upon a review of the companys anticipated future taxable income, and including all other available evidence, both positive and negative, the companys management has concluded that, notwithstanding the items noted above, it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets will be realized.under u.s. income tax rules, only 35% of non life operating losses can be offset against life insurance taxable income each year. for current u.s. income tax purposes, as of december 31, 2023, there were non life operating loss carryforwards of $109 million available to offset against future taxable income, all of which do not expire. the company has no capital loss carryforwards available to offset capital gains. the company has no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of december 31, 2023 .the company files federal income tax returns in the u.s. and japan as well as state or prefecture income tax returns in various jurisdictions in the two countries. there are currently no other open federal, state, or local u.s. income tax audits. u.s. federal income tax returns for years before 2016 are no longer subject to examination. japan corporate income tax returns for years before the tax year ended march 2022 are no longer subject to examination. management believes it has established adequate tax liabilities and final resolution of all open audits is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the years ended december 31:(in millions)2023 2022 balance, beginning of year$5 $5 additions for tax positions of prior years0 0 reductions for tax positions of prior years(4) 0 balance, end of year$1 $5 included in the balance of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2023 and 2022, are no tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. the company has accrued approximately $1 million as of december 31, 2023, for permanent uncertainties, which if reversed would not have a material effect on the annual effective rate.the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. the company recognized an immaterial amount of interest and penalties in both 2023 and 2022, compared with approximately $1 million in 2021. the company accrued an immaterial amount for the payment of interest and penalties as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.as of december 31, 2023, there were no material uncertain tax positions for which the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.169item 8. financial statements and supplementary

of december 31, 2023, the company has outstanding share based awards under the aflac incorporated long term incentive plan (as amended and restated february 14, 2017), as further amended on august 9, 2022 (the plan). share based awards are designed to reward employees for their long term contributions to the company and provide incentives for them to remain with the company. the number and frequency of share based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of the company, government regulations, and other factors. 173item 8. financial statements and supplementary datathe plan allows for a maximum number of shares issuable over its term of 75 million shares including 38 million shares that may be awarded in respect of awards other than options or stock appreciation rights. if any awards granted under the plan are forfeited or are terminated before being exercised or settled for any reason other than tax forfeiture, then the shares underlying the awards will again be available under the plan.the plan allows awards to company employees for incentive stock options (isos), non qualifying stock options (nqsos), restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. non employee directors are eligible for grants of nqsos, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 34.8 million shares were available for future grants under this plan. the isos and nqsos have a term of 10 years, and the share based awards generally vest upon time based conditions or time and performance based conditions. time based vesting generally occurs after three years. performance based vesting conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to company financial performance. as of december 31, 2023, the only performance based awards issued and outstanding were restricted stock awards and units.stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the amended plan have an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date and have an expiration date no later than 10 years from the grant date. time based restricted stock awards, restricted stock awards and stock options generally vest on a ratable basis over three years. the compensation committee of the board of directors has the discretion to determine vesting schedules.share based awards granted to u.s. based grantees are settled with authorized but unissued company stock, while those issued to japan based grantees are settled with treasury shares.summary of share based compensation expenseshare based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, restricted stock awards (including performance based restricted stock awards), and restricted stock units granted to employees.the following table presents the impact of the expense recognized in connection with share based awards for the years ended december 31.(in millions, except

estimates the fair value of each stock option granted using the black scholes merton multiple option approach. expected volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate with the estimated terms of the options. the company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and termination patterns within the model. separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise patterns are stratified and considered separately for valuation purposes. the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the companys option model and represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. the company bases the risk free interest rate on the treasury note rate with a term comparable to that of the estimated term of the options. there were no options granted in 2023, 2022 or 2021. the following table presents the assumptions used in valuing options granted, if applicable, during the years ended

aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $52 million, with a weighted average remaining term of 2.2 years. the total number of in the money stock options exercisable as of december

benefit realized as a result of options exercised and restricted stock releases20 18 17 performance based restricted stock awards and unitsunder the plan, the company grants selected executive officers performance based restricted stock awards (pbrs) each february whose vesting is contingent upon meeting various performance goals. pbrs are generally granted at the money and contingently cliff vest over a period of three years, generally subject to continued employment. in february 2023, the company granted 354 thousand performance based stock awards, which are contingent on the achievement of the companys financial performance metrics and its market based conditions. on the date of grant, the company estimated the fair value of restricted stock awards with market based conditions using a monte carlo simulation model. the model discounts the value of the stock at the assumed vesting date based on a risk free interest rate. based on estimates of actual performance versus the vesting thresholds, the calculated fair value percentage pay out estimate will be updated each quarter. actual performance, including modification for relative total shareholder return, may result in the ultimate award of 0% to 200% percent of the initial number of pbrs issued, with the potential for no award if company performance goals are not achieved during the three year period. pbrs subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility are recognized over the implicit service period.the company also granted selected executive officers performance based restricted stock units (psus) throughout the year whose vesting is contingent upon meeting various performance goals. psus are generally granted at the money and contingently cliff vest over a period of three years, generally subject to continued employment. in 2023, the company granted 105 thousand performance based stock units, which are contingent on the achievement of certain company determined metrics. based on estimates of actual performance versus the vesting thresholds, the calculated fair value percentage pay out estimate will be updated each quarter. actual performance may result in the ultimate award of 0% to 200% percent of the initial number of psus issued, with the potential for no award if the company determined metrics are not achieved during the three year period. psus subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility is recognized over the implicit service period.the company uses third party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in, as well as calibrating, a monte carlo simulation model. the company is responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share based payment

with a performance based vesting condition. the company expects to recognize these amounts over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. there are no other contractual terms covering restricted stock awards once vested.13. statutory accounting and dividend restrictionsthe companys insurance subsidiaries are required to report their results of operations and financial position to insurance regulatory authorities on the basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such authorities. aflac japan must report its results of operations and financial position to the japanese financial services agency (fsa) on a japanese regulatory accounting basis as prescribed by the fsa. japanese regulatory accounting practices differ in many respects from u.s. gaap. under japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed immediately; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; premiums are recognized on a cash basis; different consolidation criteria apply to vies; reinsurance is recognized on a different basis; and investments can have a separate accounting classification and treatment referred to as policy reserve matching bonds (prm). capital and surplus of aflac japan, based on japanese regulatory accounting practices, was $8.1 billion at december 31, 2023, compared with $6.7 billion at december 31, 2022.aflac, caic and toic report statutory financial statements that are prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the nebraska department of insurance (ndoi). the ndoi recognizes statutory accounting principles and practices prescribed or permitted by the state of nebraska for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, and for determining a companys solvency under nebraska insurance law. aflac new york reports statutory financial statements that are prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the new york state department of financial services (nysdfs). the nysdfs recognizes statutory accounting principles and practices prescribed or permitted by the state of new york for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, and for determining a companys solvency under new york insurance law.177item 8. financial statements and supplementary datastatutory accounting principles (sap) as detailed by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) accounting practices and procedures manual have been adopted by both the state of nebraska and the state of new york as a component of those prescribed or permitted practices. statutory accounting practices primarily differ from u.s. gaap by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions as well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred taxes on a different basis. additionally, the director of the ndoi and the superintendent of the nysdfs each have the right to permit other specific practices which deviate from prescribed practices. aflac, caic, toic and aflac new york had no permitted practices as of december 31, 2023, and 2022.the table below represents statutory capital and surplus based on statutory

67 83 aflac re is licensed by the bma as a long term insurer and is subject to the bermuda insurance act of 1978 (bermuda insurance act). aflac re is required to file an annual return for its bermuda solvency capital requirement (bscr) which utilizes an economic balance sheet (ebs) framework to determine aflac res enhanced capital requirement (ecr). aflac re is also subject to a minimum margin of solvency (mms) related to its statutory financial statements. the mms is equal to the greater of $500,000, 1.5% of the total statutory assets, or 25% of ecr.under the ebs framework, aflac re is required to value assets equal to u.s. gaap fair values, and insurance reserves are valued using technical provisions which consist of a best estimate liability plus a risk margin. the best estimate liability can be calculated by applying the standard approach or, with regulatory approval, the scenario based approach. the standard approach uses discount rates for insurance reserves as prescribed by the bma. the scenario based approach uses a discount rate based on the yield of eligible assets owned by the insurer as determined using a series of prescribed stress scenarios. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, aflac re was in compliance with the ecr and mms requirements. statutory capital and surplus of aflac re, based on bermuda statutory accounting practices, was $439 million at december 31, 2023, compared with $195 million at december 31, 2022.the parent company depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow, primarily in the form of dividends and management fees. consolidated retained earnings in the accompanying financial statements largely represent the undistributed earnings of the companys insurance subsidiaries. amounts available for dividends, management fees and other payments to the parent company by its insurance subsidiaries may fluctuate due to different accounting methods required by regulatory authorities. these payments are also subject to various regulatory restrictions and approvals related to safeguarding the interests of insurance policyholders. the companys u.s. life insurance entities must maintain adequate risk based capital (rbc) for u.s. regulatory authorities, aflac japan must maintain adequate solvency margins for japanese regulatory authorities, and aflac re must maintain minimum capital requirements for bermuda regulatory authorities.the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the parent company by aflac, caic and toic without prior approval of nebraskas director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and 178item 8. financial statements and supplementary datasurplus as of the previous year end. in 2023, aflac declared dividends of $894 million, compared with $594 million in 2022. dividends declared by aflac during 2024 in excess of $1.1 billion would require such approval. caic and toic did not declare dividends during 2023. from time to time, aflac new york pays dividends to aflac, the parent company of aflac new york. aflac new york may not pay dividends to aflac without the prior approval of the nysdfs. aflac new york declared dividends of $67 million in 2023 and $83 million in 2022, which were authorized by the nysdfs.aflac japan is required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by japanese corporate law in order to provide dividends to the parent company. under these criteria, dividend capacity at aflac japan is basically defined as retained earnings excluding capital reserves, which represent equity generated by capital profits that are statutorily required in japan, less net after tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities based on the previous fiscal year end. profits remitted by aflac japan to the parent company were as follows for the years ended december 31: in

paying dividends in an amount that exceeds 25% of the prior years statutory capital and surplus without an affidavit stating that aflac re will continue to meet its solvency margin. further, aflac re may not reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more without prior regulatory approval. additionally, aflac re is not permitted to pay any dividends that would cause aflac re to fail to meet its minimum capital requirements. in 2023, aflac re did not pay any dividends.14. benefit planspension and other postretirement plans the company has funded defined benefit plans in japan and the u.s., however the u.s. plan was frozen to new participants effective october 1, 2013. in june 2023, the company amended the u.s. defined benefit plan to freeze future benefits under the plan for all participants effective january 1, 2024, which resulted in the company recognizing a curtailment gain of $49 million in 2023. u.s. employees who are not participants in the defined benefit plan currently receive a nonelective 401(k) employer contribution. effective january 1, 2024, the nonelective 401(k) employer contribution was extended to u.s. employees who were participants in the defined benefit plan prior to the freeze of future benefits on january 1, 2024.the company also maintains non qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement plans that provide defined pension benefits in

respectively. the company determines its discount rate assumption for its u.s. pension retirement obligations based on indices for aa corporate bonds with an average duration of approximately 14 years, and determination of the u.s. pension plan discount rate utilizes the 85 year extrapolated yield curve. in japan, the discount rate assumption is determined using the yield curve equivalent approach, and participant salary and future salary increases are not factors in determining pension benefit cost or the related pension benefit obligation.the company bases its assumption for the long term rate of return on assets on historical trends (10 year or longer historical rates of return for the japanese plan assets and 15 year historical rates of return for the u.s. plan assets), expected future market movement, as well as the portfolio mix of securities in the asset portfolio including, but not limited to, style, class and equity and fixed income allocations. in addition, the companys consulting actuaries evaluate its assumptions for long term rates of return under actuarial standards of practice (asop). under the asop, the actual portfolio type, mix and class is modeled to determine a best estimate of the long term rate of return. the company in turn use those results to further validate its own assumptions.181item 8. financial statements and supplementary

japanese and u.s. funded defined benefit plans is to preserve the purchasing power of the plans assets and earn a reasonable inflation adjusted rate of return over the long term. furthermore, the company seeks to accomplish these objectives in a manner that allows for the adequate funding of plan benefits and expenses. in order to achieve these objectives, the companys goal is to maintain a conservative, well diversified and balanced portfolio of high quality equity, fixed income and money market securities. as a part of its strategy, the company has established strict policies covering quality, type and concentration of investment securities. for the companys japanese plan, these policies include limitations on investments in derivatives including futures, options and swaps, and low liquidity investments such as real estate, venture capital investments, and privately issued securities. for the companys u.s. plan, these policies prohibit investments in precious metals, limited

the accompanying report of independent registered public accounting firm.203item 16. form 10 k summaryitem 16. form 10 k summarynot applicable.204glossary of selected termsthroughout this annual report on form 10 k, the company may use certain performance metrics and other terms which are defined below.adjusted net investment income net investment income adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity and ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains and (losses) to net investment income. the company considers adjusted net investment income important because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and income associated with the companys investments and related hedging strategies. the metric is used in segment reporting as a component of segment profitability.affiliated corporate agency agency in japan directly affiliated with a specific corporation that sells insurance policies primarily to its employees.annualized premiums in force the amount of gross premium that a policyholder must pay over a full year in order to keep coverage. the growth of net earned premiums (defined below) is directly affected by the change in premiums in force and by the change in weighted average yen/dollar exchange rates.average weekly producer the total number of writing agents who have produced greater than $0.00 during the production week excluding any manual adjustments divided by the number of weeks in the time period. the company believes this metric allows sales management to monitor progress and needs, as well as serve as a leading indicator of future production capacity.capital buffer established dollar amount of liquidity at the parent company reserved for injecting capital into the insurance entities or general liquidity support for general expenses at the parent company.earnings per basic share net earnings divided by weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.earnings per diluted share net earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the weighted average shares for the dilutive effect of share based awards outstanding.group insurance insurance issued to a group, such as an employer or trade association, that covers employees or association members and their dependents through certificates of coverage.individual insurance insurance issued to an individual with the policy designed to cover that person and his or her dependents.in force policies a count of policies that are active contracts at the end of a period. liquidity support internally defined and established dollar amount of liquidity reserved for supporting potential collateral and settlements of derivatives at the parent company. net investment income the income derived from interest and dividends on invested assets, after deducting investment expenses.net earned premiums is a financial measure that appears on the companys consolidated statements of earnings and in its segment reporting. this measure reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period, reduced by premiums that have been ceded to third parties and increased by premiums assumed through reinsurance.new annualized premium sales (sometimes referred to as new sales or sales) an operating measure that is not reflected on the companys financial statements. new annualized premium sales generally represent annual premiums on policies and riders the company sold and incremental increases from policy conversions that would be collected over a 12 month period assuming the policies remain in force for that entire period. for aflac japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. for aflac u.s., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. policy conversions are defined as the positive difference in the annualized premium when a policy upgrades in the current reporting period. the company believes that this metric is a key indicator of the companys future source of earnings. new money yield gross yields earned on purchases of fixed maturities, loan receivables, and equities. purchases exclude capitalized interest, securities lending/repurchase agreements, short term/cash activity, and alternatives. new money yield for equities is based on the assumed dividend yield at the time of purchase. the new money yield for aflac japan excludes the impact of any derivatives and associated amortized hedge costs associated with usd denominated investments. management uses this metric as a leading indicator of future investment earning potential.operating ratios used to evaluate the companys financial condition and profitability. examples include: (1) ratios to total adjusted revenues, which present expenses as a percentage of total revenues and (2) ratios to total premium, including benefit ratio. 205 premium persistency percentage of premiums remaining in force at the end of a period, usually one year, and presented on a trailing 12 month basis. for example, 95% persistency would mean that 95% of the premiums in force at the beginning of the period were still in force at the end of the period. the company believes that this metric is a key driver of in force levels, which is a key measure of the size of the companys business and future sources of earnings.pretax adjusted earnings earnings as adjusted earnings before the application of income taxes. this measure is used in the companys segment reporting. pretax adjusted profit margin adjusted earnings divided by adjusted revenues, before taxes are applied. this measure is used in the companys segment reporting.return on average invested assets net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets during the period. management uses this metric to demonstrate how the companys actual net investment income results represent an overall return on the portfolio to provide a more comparative metric as the size of the companys investment portfolio changes over time. risk based capital (rbc) ratio statutory adjusted capital divided by statutory required capital. this insurance ratio is based on rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) and provides an indication of the amount of statutory capital the insurance company maintains, relative to the inherent risks in the insurers operations.solvency margin ratio (smr) solvency margin total divided by one half of the risk total. this insurance ratio is prescribed by the japan financial services agency (fsa) and is used for all life insurance companies in japan to measure the adequacy of the companys ability to pay policyholder claims in the event actual risks exceed expected levels.statutory earnings earnings determined according to accounting rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic), as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. these statutory accounting rules are different from u.s. gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency.weighted average foreign currency exchange rate japan segment operating earnings for the period (excluding hedge costs) in yen divided by japan segment operating earnings for the period (excluding hedge costs) in dollars. management uses this metric to evaluate and determine consolidated results on foreign currency effective basis.
