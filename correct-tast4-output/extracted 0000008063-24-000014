As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of $7.5 million for outstanding accounts receivable and $3.6 million for dedicated inventory. The associated assets existed prior to 2023.Products and CustomersOur Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification, and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (OEM) that build aircraft for the commercial transport, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEMs, aircraft operators such as airlines, suppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense. During 2023, this segments sales were divided 72% to the commercial transport market, 10% to the military aircraft market, 13% to the general aviation market and 5% to other markets. Most of this segments sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed on a day to day basis or for single year procurements rather than long term multi year contract commitments. On occasion, the Company does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple year deliveries of hardware to our customers.Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it pursues large, often multi year, projects.Sales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 20 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.We have a significant concentration of business with one major customer, The Boeing Company (Boeing). Sales to Boeing accounted for 11.0% of sales in 2023, 11.0% of sales in 2022, and 10.0% of sales in 2021. Sales to Boeing are primarily in the Aerospace segment. StrategyOur strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and use those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to our targeted markets where our technology can be beneficial.Practices as to Maintaining Working CapitalLiquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.Competitive ConditionsWe experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and price, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than we do. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets.Government ContractsAll U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to termination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 12% of our 2023 consolidated sales were made to U.S. government related markets.Government RegulationThe FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Its regulations are designed to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are continuously maintained in proper condition to ensure safe operation of the aircraft. Similar rules apply in other countries. All aircraft must be maintained under a continuous condition monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. Certification and conformance is required 5prior to installation of a part on an aircraft. Our operations may in the future be subject to new and more stringent regulatory requirements. In that regard, we closely monitor the FAA and industry trade groups in an attempt to understand how possible future regulations might impact us. Our businesses which sell products directly to the U.S. Government or for use in systems delivered to the U.S. Government can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors.There has been no material adverse effect to our Consolidated Financial Statements nor competitive positions as a result of these government regulations.Raw MaterialsMaterials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although potentially disruptive in the short term, would not materially affect our operations in the long term.SeasonalityOur business is typically not seasonal.BacklogAt December 31, 2023, our consolidated backlog was $592.3 million. At December 31, 2022, our backlog was $571.4 million. The increase in backlog is driven primarily by recovering demand from our commercial transport and general aviation customers, with increased OEM build rates and increased spending by commercial airlines on fleet improvements.Backlog in the Aerospace segment was $517.2 million at December 31, 2023, of which $474.5 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2024. Backlog in the Test Systems segment was $75.0 million at December 31, 2023. The Test Systems segment expects to recognize $52.1 million of this backlog as revenue in 2024.
