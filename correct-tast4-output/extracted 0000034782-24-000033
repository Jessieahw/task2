REGULATION AND SUPERVISIONGeneral 1st Source and the Bank are extensively regulated under federal and state law. To the extent the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA), subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). We are required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as required.The Bank, as an Indiana state bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to prudential supervision by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (FRB Chicago). 1st Source Bank is regularly examined by and subject to regulations promulgated by the DFI and the Federal Reserve. Because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance to the Bank, we are also subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC (even though the FDIC is not our primary Federal regulator). The Bank is also subject to regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and to supervision for compliance with such regulations by the DFI and the FRB Chicago.Bank Holding Company Act Under the BHCA our activities are limited to (i) business so closely related to banking, managing, or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto and (ii) non bank activities, determined by law or regulation, to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. The BHCA also requires a bank holding company to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring or holding more than 5% voting interest in any bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.5Table of ContentsCapital Standards The federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a bank holding company or bank must submit an acceptable plan for achieving compliance with the capital guidelines and, until its capital sufficiently improves, will be subject to denial of applications and appropriate supervisory enforcement actions. For banks, the FDICs prompt corrective action regulations establish five capital levels for financial institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized), and impose mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations on institutions that are less than adequately capitalized. At December 31, 2023, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized, meaning that our total risk based capital ratio exceeded 10.00%, our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio exceeded 8.00%, our common equity Tier 1 risk based capital ratio exceeded 6.50%, our leverage ratio exceeded 5.00%, and we are not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 1st Source and the Bank have elected not to utilize the community bank leverage ratio framework adopted by the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies in 2020. Regulatory capital requirements to which we are subject are disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements and guidelines.Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) We are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC and certain states for matters relating to the offering and sale of our securities. We are subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol SRCE, and we are subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) The GLBA provides for financial activities that a bank may conduct through a financial subsidiary and established a distinct type of bank holding company, known as a financial holding company, which may engage in defined activities that are financial in nature. These activities include securities and insurance brokerage, securities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking. We do not currently intend to file notice with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the Bank.Financial Privacy The GLBA also includes privacy protections for nonpublic personal information held by financial institutions regarding their customers. Rules under GLBA limit the ability of banks to disclose non public information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLBA affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. We are also subject to various state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, that generally require us (directly or indirectly through our vendors) to protect the personal information of individual customers and notify them if confidentiality of their personal information is or may have been compromised as the result of a data security breach or failure.USA Patriot Act of 2001 Regulations under the USA Patriot Act require financial institutions to maintain appropriate controls to combat money laundering activities, perform due diligence of private banking and correspondent accounts, establish standards for verifying customer identity, and provide records related to suspected anti money laundering activities upon request from federal authorities. A financial institutions failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches, and could also have other serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) The CRA requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the record of the financial institutions they examined in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Federal banking regulators will consider our performance in these areas as they review any applications we may file to engage in mergers or acquisitions or to open a branch or facility.On October 24, 2023, federal banking agencies issued a final rule designed to strengthen and modernize the regulations implementing the CRA. The changes are designed to encourage banks to expand access to credit, investment and banking services in low and moderate income communities, adapt to industry changes including mobile and internet banking, provide greater clarity and consistency in the application of CRA regulations and tailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type.6Table of ContentsLaws and Regulations Governing Extensions of Credit The Bank is subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to 1st Source or our subsidiaries, and on investments in our securities and the use of our securities as collateral for loans to any borrowers. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from the Bank for our cash needs, including funds for acquisitions and for payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. Further, the BHCA, certain regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, state laws and many other federal laws govern extensions of credit and generally prohibit a bank from extending credit, engaging in a lease or sale of property, or furnishing services to a customer on condition that the customer request and obtain additional services from the banks holding company or from one of its subsidiaries.The Bank is also subject to numerous restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders of the Bank or 1st Source or any related interest of such persons.Reserve Requirements Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction account deposits. In March 2020, in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve set the reserve requirement ratio for all net transaction accounts to zero percent, and this requirement remained in place throughout 2023; therefore, all of the Banks net transaction accounts as of December 31, 2023 were exempt from reserve requirements.Dividends The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is limited by state and federal laws and regulations that require the Bank to obtain the prior approval of the DFI and the FRB Chicago before paying a dividend that, together with other dividends it has paid during a calendar year, would exceed the sum of its net income for the year to date combined with its retained net income for the previous two years. The amount of dividends the Bank may pay may also be limited by certain covenant agreements and by the principles of prudent bank management. See Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for further discussion of dividend limitations.Monetary Policy and Economic Control The commercial banking business also is affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the discount window, open market operations, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits and assets of foreign branches, and the imposition of, and changes in, reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates, are some of the tools of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve. These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and such use may affect interest rates charged on loans and leases or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to do so in the future. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve are influenced by various factors, including economic growth, inflation, unemployment, short term and long term changes in the international trade balance, and in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government. Future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our future business and earnings, and the effect on the future business and earnings of the Bank cannot be predicted.In March 2023, the Federal Reserve created a Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to provide funding to eligible depository institutions in addition to the funding provided through its discount window. The BTFP offers loans up to one year in length that can be prepaid without penalty. The amount that can be borrowed under the BTFP is based upon the par value of the securities pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve. Advances can be requested under the BTFP until March 11, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Bank had $100 million of BTFP borrowings. Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (SOA) The SOA includes provisions intended to enhance corporate responsibility and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws, and which increase penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at public traded companies. The SOA generally applies to all companies, including 1st Source, that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.SOA also addresses functions and responsibilities of audit committees of public companies. The statute, by mandating certain stock exchange listing rules, makes the audit committee directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the companys outside auditor, and requires the auditor to report directly to the audit committee. The SOA requires that audit committees be empowered to engage independent counsel and other advisors, and requires a public company to provide funding to pay the companys auditors and any advisors the audit committee retains.7Table of ContentsConsumer Financial Protection Laws The Bank is subject to numerous federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations that extensively govern its transactions with consumers. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Service Members Civil Relief Act. The Bank must also comply with applicable state usury and other credit and deposit related laws and regulations and other laws and regulations prohibiting unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices. These laws and regulations, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and the terms of deposit accounts, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, restrict the Banks ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of these laws may expose us to liability from potential lawsuits brought by affected customers. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce these consumer financial protection laws, in which case we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties, and customer rescission rights. Failure to comply with these laws may also cause the Federal Reserve or DFI to deny approval of any applications we may file to engage in merger and acquisition transactions with other financial institutions or open a new banking center. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act The Dodd Frank Act includes provisions that, among other things, relax rules on interstate branching, allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, and impose heightened capital requirements on bank holding companies. The Dodd Frank Act also established the CFPB as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, and transferred to the CFPB primary responsibility for administering substantially all federal consumer compliance protection laws. The Dodd Frank Act also authorizes the CFPB to promulgate consumer protection regulations that apply to all entities, including banks, that offer consumer financial services or products. It also includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and pre payment penalties. The Volcker Rule The Dodd Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. This provision is commonly called the Volcker Rule. The regulations implementing the Volcker Rule exempt the Bank, as a bank with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that does not engage in any covered activities other than trading in certain government, agency, state or municipal obligations, from any significant compliance obligations under the Volcker Rule.
